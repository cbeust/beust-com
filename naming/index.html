<P>In this article, I discuss the various naming conventions that are used
in C++ and Java, and try to explain which ones should be adopted in Java
and what others could be left. The end goal is to make the transition to
a more uniform Java naming style as smooth as possible. Everything that
follows should be read as personal ideas and advice, not as imperative
directions you should adhere to unconditionally. You should start by reading
<A HREF="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/javaCodingStd.html">Doug Lea's
coding standard</A> to get a general idea on conventions, and then use
the following discussion to make decisions for yourself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
STANDARD CONVENTIONS IN C++</H3>
Usually, a C++ class header will present the public, protected and then
private parts, in that order. While there is no real guideline regarding
private and protected layout, we usually see in the public part :
<UL>
<LI>
constructors</LI>

<LI>
copy constructors</LI>

<LI>
destructors</LI>
</UL>
then follow member functions, operators and friendship statements.

<P>As a corollary, the datamembers (usually private or protected) will
be sent back to the bottom of the class. The rationale here is that when
you are looking at a header, you are interested in the interface part of
the class, and you don't want to have your reading impeded by implementation
details.

<P>Member functions usually start with a lower case (following the Smalltalk
trend), and static ones are capitalized :
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>// C++</TT>
<BR><TT>void aFunction();</TT>
<BR><TT>static void AStaticFunction();</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Most of the time, datamembers will be flagged with a specific naming convention.
The most common is a leading underscore, but you can see variations :
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>// C++</TT>
<BR><TT>int _name;</TT>
<BR><TT>int name_;</TT>
<BR><TT>int m_name;</TT>
<BR><TT>int ivName;&nbsp;&nbsp; // for "instance variable"</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
and for static :
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>// C++</TT>
<BR><TT>static int _Name;</TT>
<BR><TT>static int Name_;</TT>
<BR><TT>// not sure what the static equivalent for m_name is...</TT>
<BR><TT>static int cvName;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // for "class variable"</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
STANDARD CONVENTIONS FOR JAVA</H3>
These conventions are much looser in Java.

<P>public, protected and private functions are usually scattered throughout
the class, and attributes tend to be declared at the top of the class.

<P>The naming of methods obeys the same rule as C++, but it also applies
to static functions :
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>public void aFunction();</TT>
<BR><TT>static public void aStaticFunction();</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
No naming convention is used for attributes, they just can't be distinguished
from standard "auto" variables (more on this below). Referencing attributes
is often performed via this :
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>// Java</TT>
<BR><TT>void f(String name) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; this.name = name;</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
There is of course much more to be said on Java conventions, but I will
focus on these issues since they are relevant to C++. Once again, take
a look at <A HREF="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/javaCodingStd.html">Doug
Lea's</A> ideas on the matter.
<H3>
WHY DO THESE NOTATIONS DIFFER ?</H3>
Obviously, Java has a lot less standard naming guidelines than C++. This
can probably be explained by the relative youth of the language compared
to C++. However, I just can't accept this excuse as is, because at least
something should have been learned with C++. While Java authors tried to
reuse some of the knowledge gained during the evolution of C++, they seem
to have left aside crucial pieces of information. Meaningful naming is
one of those. But as we will see below, things are not as dramatic as they
might seem.

<P>Let's first take a look at the rationale behind some of C++ namings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>- Differentiating static and member functions
<BLOCKQUOTE>The idea between this distinction is that making a member function
static (or the other way around) is not just a syntactic change. It has
deep implications that often go as far as the design of the whole framework
itself. While static functions are simply "datamember functions without
a this parameter", their place in the overall environment is considerably
modified when this status changes.

<P>Imposing a name distinction forces the programmer to go through all
their code again and make sure that not only the former code will keep
compiling and working, but possibly remove or add lines of code. For example,
making a member function static will probably allow you to create less
objects, thus avoiding needless new's.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>- Differentiating datamembers and local variables
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a very important step, and I really feel angry each
time I see this teaching was lost when moving to Java. Without a proper
naming convention, you can run in very stupid bugs that should never happen.
Consider :
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><TT>// Java</TT>
<BR><TT>class A {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; String name;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; public void f(String h) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.name = name;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This code will compile just fine but the bug will make you
lose some precious time.

<P>Another gain in differentiating datamembers is when you need to read
code. Without the proper convention, it is very difficult to see if a function
modifies <TT>this</TT> or not (in C++, whether it is <TT>const</TT> or
not). If you go for the leading _ notation, the presence of a _ in the
piece of code you are perusing gives you an immediate hint about what the
functions does on <TT>this</TT>.

<P>One last important gain : it completely rules out possible "hiding"
<BR>situations :

<P><TT>// Java</TT>
<BR><TT>class A {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; int a;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; public void f() {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int a = 0;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 42;&nbsp;&nbsp; // mmmh... do we mean a
or this.a ?</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>- Layout of the classes
<BLOCKQUOTE>While seeing datamembers declared at the top of a class will
surely shock most C++ programmers, it can actually make sense if you add
interfaces into the equation.

<P>C++ doesn't have "native" support for interfaces. Usually, the <TT>.hpp</TT>
file will be used as the interface (definition) of the class (possibly
using pure virtual functions, but that's a detail).

<P>While Java doesn't distinguish "header file" and "implementation file",
interfaces serve this purpose just fine. The situation can be summed up
this way :
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER COLS=3 WIDTH="60%" NOSAVE >
<TR ALIGN=CENTER NOSAVE>
<TD></TD>

<TD NOSAVE>Java</TD>

<TD>C++</TD>
</TR>

<TR ALIGN=CENTER NOSAVE>
<TD NOSAVE>Interface</TD>

<TD ALIGN=CENTER NOSAVE>interface</TD>

<TD NOSAVE>.hpp file</TD>
</TR>

<TR ALIGN=CENTER NOSAVE>
<TD NOSAVE>Implementation</TD>

<TD NOSAVE>.java file</TD>

<TD>.cpp file</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P>Seeing the picture with the above table in mind, you can see how it
makes sense to have attributes declared on top of the <TT>.java</TT> file
: it's because this file is the implementation of the class. Anybody reading
it will be interested in implementation details, and in that respect, a
cursory glance of the attributes might be of some help.

<P>Of course, for this to fully work, one must program extensively with
interfaces, and I can only hope that interfaces will be more and more used
in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;
<H3>
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH JAVA NAMING</H3>
Obviously, some compromises must be made in the current situation : C++
conventions are probably a little too stringent and not necessarily in
phase with Java, while the current Java conventions (or lack thereof) are
definitely not sufficient for any midsized project.

<P>Of all the above points, there is but one that should be adopted without
exception in Java : standard convention for attributes.

<P>Attributes <B>must</B> be distinguished from plain old "automatic" variables
syntactically. You can adopt whichever norm you prefer (the most widespread
being probably <TT>_name</TT> and <TT>m_name</TT>), but use it consistently
and encourage everyone around you to do the same.

<P>There will be reluctance, of course, because some people have aesthetic
considerations when it comes to code appearance, but with proper highlighting,
the uniform naming makes a lot of sense.

<P>I personally use a "soft" highlighting to flag attributes in my code,
and I use a "strong" highlighting (for example using a different background
or a bold case) when such attributes are assigned. This makes a tremendous
difference when browsing code. Here is an example :
<BR><IMG SRC="highlight.gif" HEIGHT=251 WIDTH=300>&nbsp;

<P>(this example also features some personal highlighting which a few people
will most likely find way too psychedelic to their taste, so you should
focus on the attributes colors solely).&nbsp; The sample code in elisp
that allows that kind of highlighting can be found <A HREF="colors.el">here</A>.

<P>Apart from this mandatory requirement, the other conventions in C++
can or should be dropped in order not to make the transition to a better
Java coding style too painful. I can live without being able to distinguish
static functions from member ones. The same goes for attributes. Note that
it is a compromise I have accepted to make, but if I was to work alone
on a project, I would probably stick to them anyway because I know that
it won't annoy greatly "standard" Java programmers if they must read my
code one day.

<P>I would insist on having static functions prefixed with their class,
though :
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>void f() {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; aNonStaticFunction();</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; ClassName.aStaticFunction();</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
This seems to be a reasonable compromise as far as naming is concerned
and makes it clear that the invoked function is not using <TT>this</TT>
at all.
