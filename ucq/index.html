Ultimate Craft Queue (UCQ) is a World of Warcraft add-on meant to help glyph makers
maintain their inventory.  In a nutshell, this add-on lets you say that you want
your inventory to contain n glyphs of each type, and it will then calculate how many
glyphs you need to craft to reach that result.  But as you will see below, you
can actually fine tune the process quite a bit.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

This add-on is based on <a href="http://www.ithinkincode.com/warcraft/index.php/ktq/">Kev's Tool Queue</a>, which provides similar functionalities but
with less options.  As such, UCQ has the same requirements:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/altoholic.aspx">Altoholic</a>
<li><a href="http://www.wowace.com/addons/skillet/repositories/lilsparkys-clone/files/">Skillet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/lil-sparkys-workshop.aspx">LilSparky's Workshop</a>
<li><a href="http://auctioneeraddon.com/dl/">Auctioneer</a> (optional, only needed for the <tt>threshold</tt> functionality, see below)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<a href="http://beust.com/ucq/UltimateCraftQueue.zip">Download the add-on</a> and unzip it
in your AddOns directory.

<h3>Launching UCQ</h3>

Type

<blockquote>
/ucq
</blockquote>

and then open your trade skill window.

<h3>Using UCQ</h3>

</p>


Here is the description of all the elements on the user interface.

<p align="center">
<img src="http://beust.com/ucq/ucq-stacksize.png" />
</p>


This is the main parameter of your crafting: it's the number of glyph
that you want to have when the crafting is done. UCQ takes your
alts into account, so you don't need to have these glyphs on the
current character.
<p>
For example, if you set a stack size of 5, that you have two glyphs of X
     on you and your alt has one, UCQ will add 2 to the queue in order to reach
     the desired size of 5.

</p>

<p>

The minimum value that a glyph must have to be queued. UCQ will skip all the glyphs
under this value.
<p>

<em>Note: this option requires Auctioneer. It will be ignored if Auctioneer is not installed. Also, the price is retrieved from Auctioneer, so be sure your Auctioneer data is accurate</em>

<p align="center">
<img src="http://beust.com/ucq/ucq-bonusqueue.png" />
</p>

If a glyph has completely sold out (e.g. you require a stack size of 4 and UCQ determines
it needs to queue 4 glyphs) then you can use the value in the bonus queue to create
additional glyphs. The idea is that if that glyph sold out, it's probably because it's
in high demand, so you might as well craft a few more.

<p>
<p align="center">

</p>

Checking this box will instruct UCQ not to queue single items. When you only sold
one glyph of a certain type, your herbs might be better spent on the bonus queue
instead of replacing that underperforming glyph.

<p>

<p align="center">
<img src="http://beust.com/ucq/ucq-overrides.png" />
</p>
<p>

This panel lets you override the stack size specified above on a per-class basis.
For example, you might have determined that on your server, Warrior glyphs always
sell very well while Priests tend not to.  In such a situation, you might want
to set the Warrior stack size to 6 and Priest's to 3.  Of course, the adjustments
described above will still be applied (so if a Priest glyph sold out and you specified
a bonus queue of 1, UCQ will craft 4 of this glyph).

<p>

Once you're satisfied, make sure that your Advanced Trade Skill window is up and
press the "Create Queue" button:  you should see the trade skill window populated with the full
queue:

</p>
<p>

Finally, you can also click on the "Log" tab, which will give you a full summary
of what glyphs were queued, which ones were not and why, along with a final tally:
