<p align="center">Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA<br>
June 10th - 14th, 2003</p>

<p>This is a consolidated view of the weblog entries I posted throughout the 
conference.&nbsp; If you are interested in reading the comments, check out the

<p><i>Disclaimer:&nbsp; if you are not used to the tone I use to make these 
summaries, I recommend taking a look at my previous reports on JavaOne:&nbsp;

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>We are halfway through day one at JavaOne, and so far, things have been 
interesting.</p>
<p>The good news:&nbsp; <a href="http://beust.com/javaone-2001.html">Pat</a>
<a href="http://beust.com/javaone2002.html">Sueltz</a> is nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; 
The bad news:&nbsp; the keynotes are exclusively by Sun employees.&nbsp; Also, 
the conference has shrunk substantially.&nbsp; My insider spies whispered to me 
the number 5000 attendants, quite a change from last year's 16,000 (which was 
already in recession compared to the previous year: 20,000, which was the peak).</p>
<p>As usual, John Gage opened the fest and quickly stepped down to let Jonathan 
Schwartz address the crowd.&nbsp; I have to admit I enjoyed his speech.&nbsp; It 
was entertaining, sent some pretty strong signals (more on this below) and not 
too long.&nbsp; Jonathan also invited a few other guests on stage although I 
can't say I have been extremely impressed by their performance.</p>
<p>It seems that after trying to conquer the desktop (J2SE), then the enterprise 
(J2EE) and failing at both, Sun is now trying to make money in the micro space.&nbsp; 
J2ME is therefore receiving a huge exposure so far and we have been literally 
drowned in numbers with six zeros and more since 8:30am this morning.</p>
<p>John Fowler then stepped on stage and emphasized a few other general themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java everywhere</li>
  <li>One platform (unifying J2ME, J2SE and J2EE...&nbsp; beg your pardon?)</li>
  <li>Ease of development</li>
  <li>Java for Visual Basic users (interesting challenge when you see what's 
  coming up in the JDK 1.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>This afternoon, Graham Hamilton and Tom Lindholm took over and delivered a 
more technical presentation.</p>
<p>Graham went through all the novelties that are going to make it into Tiger 
and that have already been widely debated in the blogsphere.&nbsp; Each one of 
them was applauded or greeted with indifference (no booing, though, as Graham 
noticed later when I talked to him).&nbsp; These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generics (applauses)</li>
  <li>For loop (no reactions)</li>
  <li>Metadata (applauses)</li>
  <li>Enums (big applauses)</li>
  <li>Autoboxing (shy applauses)</li>
  <li>printf syntax (big applauses...&nbsp; uh? What is wrong with you people?)</li>
</ul>
<p>No mention of the varargs addition, though, which Graham later told me he 
purposely removed from his presentation.</p>
<p>As much as Graham's presentation was entertaining, Tom Lindholm was just a 
litany of countless boring numbers about the embedded space.&nbsp; The fact that 
he was reading from a big notepad and stuttering constantly certainly didn't 
help captivate the crowd (rereading the report I wrote in 2001, I noticed that 
Tim's irritating habit already annoyed me back then...)</p>
<p>After the keynote, I hang out with Cameron, chatted briefly with Josh and 
then headed back to work.&nbsp; Tonight should be interesting with Josh and Neal 
addressing the JavaByTheBay user group, and later, the Borland party.</p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>Last night, I hang out with Cameron and Chiara at the Borland party.&nbsp; We 
set the place on fire, like we did last year, and I have to say it was a pretty 
cool event.</p>
<p>This morning, Rich Green was on stage for most of the keynote and delivered 
messages that were fairly similar to those we heard yesterday.&nbsp; I usually 
enjoy his presentations and this one didn't disappoint me, despite its aridity.&nbsp; 
More interestingly, Rich unveiled two products that Sun will be releasing in the 
next few months:&nbsp; Rave and Relator.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rave is a visual tool that allows you to build Web Services based on JSF.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately for Sun, the demo gods were a bit facetious today and the demo 
  crashed.&nbsp; The demo person explained &quot;it's the database that crashed, it 
  will be back up in a moment&quot; and then...&nbsp; proceeded to rebuild the 
  application from scratch.&nbsp; Sorry buddy, you can't pull this kind of trick 
  in a room filled with thousands of developers.&nbsp; Anyway, the demo worked 
  the second time.<br>
  <br>
  I have to say I was quite surprised by the slickness of Rave, until I realized 
  why:&nbsp; it doesn't seem to be based on NetBeans.&nbsp; Well, that's my 
  impression.&nbsp; I was a bit far from the screen to be sure, but it certainly 
  didn't look like the standard NetBeans interface to me.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I am a bit unsure about what Relator does exactly, but it seems to help 
  you connect J2ME and J2[S|E] applications.&nbsp; The demo involved connecting 
  to the same back-end used by a previous demo and delivering the information on 
  a phone and a PDA.&nbsp; As opposed to Rave, Relator is definitely a NetBeans 
  plug-in, the sluggishness and odd-looking Metal look and feel leave no doubt 
  about that.</li>
</ul>
<p>If my assumption about Rave is true, Sun is in a conundrum that they are now 
sadly accustomed to:&nbsp; having two competing projects in the spotlight and 
having to explain to developers which one they should use (EJB and JDO anyone?).</p>
<p>Despite the little crash, Sun's demo was still far better than SAP's.</p>
<p>The poor demo guy was struggling to get his script back on track but the more 
he tried, the more the demo crashed.&nbsp; He seemed to be making a lot of 
mistakes, too, leading me to think he didn't rehearse it very hard.&nbsp; At the 
end, the main speaker preempted him in a desperate attempt at doing some damage 
control.</p>
<p>By this time, it was almost 10:30 and James Gosling still hadn't appeared.&nbsp; 
As I was wondering if they had canceled him, Rich finally stepped down and James 
proceeded with what he usually does during his keynotes:&nbsp; throw t-shirts in 
the crowd in inventive ways and show boring demos.</p>
<p>I have to say the trebuchet was pretty cool, but the rest was very 
underwhelming:&nbsp; two demos showing real-time Java in action.&nbsp; You would 
think that after the piano-playing robot of the previous year, they would learn 
what makes an exciting or a dull demo, but I guess not.</p>
<p>Here is the truth about James Gosling:</p>
<p>He is just a regular geek, like you and me.&nbsp; A few years ago, he came up 
with an idea that happened at the right time at the right place.&nbsp; Besides 
that, he has no vision nor interest in any of the stuff that Sun is presenting 
during these keynotes.&nbsp; He even admitted that he hadn't been involved in 
any Java effort in the past two years.&nbsp; So my plea is:&nbsp; leave the poor 
guy alone.&nbsp; He doesn't like to be on stage, all he wants to do is hack on 
his things and be left alone.</p>
<p>No keynotes tomorrow and Scott will be speaking Friday.&nbsp; This should be 
entertaining.</p>
<h3>Day 4</h3>

<p>I took some time yesterday to hang out with Floyd, Dion, Ted Neward, Brad 
Merrill (.Net evangelist) and a few other folks that a veil of excellent Pinot 
noir (excellent choice, Brad) is preventing me from remembering.</p>
<p>Today was the highly anticipated Scott Mc Nealy keynote.&nbsp; Before I go 
more into details, let me say that I really enjoyed his presentation.&nbsp; It 
was never boring and despite the fact that Scott doesn't have a great presence 
on stage, he manages to capture your attention and make you look forward to what 
he is going to say next.&nbsp; I also give him a lot of credit for avoiding to 
turn his presentation into a hostile philippic aimed at Microsoft.</p>
<p>That being said, I need to outline a few things that did not resonate well 
with the overall presentation.</p>
<p>The first thing was Scott saying something like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... and remember:&nbsp; before you deploy your enterprise application in 
production, make sure you deploy to a couple of more application servers, just 
to make sure you are avoiding any vendor lock-in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mmmh...&nbsp; this makes me wonder if Scott knows how this industry really 
works.&nbsp; A couple of points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardly any company can afford the luxury to port their application on 
  several servers unless it's a clear business need.&nbsp; When you are about to 
  go live with an enterprise application, the last thing you care for is 
  &quot;avoiding vendor lock-in&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Scott seems to forget that while the J2EE specification is an outstanding 
  achievement, it is not enough in itself to put applications in production.&nbsp; 
  A lot of pieces are not part of it (clustering, performance settings, mapping to databases, etc...) 
  so your application is bound to have a certain amount of vendor lock-in.&nbsp; 
  It is a testament to the quality of the J2EE specification that this &quot;certain 
  amount&quot; is typically very small and clearly delineated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scott showed the headline of today's San Jose Mercury News, which features a 
negative article about Sun (as is an
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/40mcnealy.html">article in 
Wired</a> this month).&nbsp; I found his reaction was very defensive, basically boiling 
down to &quot;don't believe everything you read in the press&quot;.</p>
<p>Scott also mentioned that he used to be accused of over-hyping Java.&nbsp; 
Now, he's saying that actually, he under-hyped it.&nbsp; He follows up by saying 
that Java is finally on the  desktop.</p>
<p>Well...&nbsp; kind of.&nbsp; Some major accomplishments have certainly been 
made in the last year but last time I checked, most of the traditional end-user 
applications were still not Java-based (not even OpenOffice).</p>
<p>He also admits that while they are not #1 in producing Java software (quite 
a surprising confession from him), it doesn't really matter at the end of the day, because</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>...&nbsp; even if you don't make money <b>in</b> the language, you can make 
money<b> on</b> it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting spin on the fact that the only way Sun is making money off 
Java right now is by selling hardware.</p>
<p>At this point, Scott invited &quot;someone&quot; to come on stage (he was confused 
quite a few times about the schedule of his presentation and on the names of the 
various guests.&nbsp; I have the impression that there was little rehearsal or that he 
was overly tired, although he looked quite okay on stage).</p>
<p>The person in question is the Verizon CIO who proceeded to explain in very 
complicated terms what was supposed to be a very simple concept that Verizon is 
working on.&nbsp; Scott 
tried hard to extract the important parts of the explanations and present them 
to the baffled audience, but I don't think he really succeeded:&nbsp; it was 
only by the end of the demo that I began to understand what this was about.&nbsp; 
In short, Verizon is trying to introduce a universal portal unifying all your 
various devices (although he refused to call it &quot;universal messaging&quot;, probably 
because this term has been tainted by the many failed attempts in the past 
years).&nbsp; This is indeed a very cool concept but the demo was a flop:&nbsp; 
all they showed is a window popping up as a phone call is made, and a call 
forwarded from a phone to a Blackberry.&nbsp; Verizon needs to work on their 
message delivery, because I believe this stuff is promising and they could have 
wowed the crowd with it.</p>
<p>The next part was the obligatory Microsoft jabs in the form of report cards comparing Java and .Net.&nbsp; You can guess the outcome, but I 
don't think that anyone was fooled by the fact that a fair comparison should 
have involved Java in its second year of inception, since it is .Net's current 
age.&nbsp; Besides, Scott could also have emphasized that Java's age is a very 
important asset over .Net, not something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>The presentation occasionally included a few gems which garnered tumultuous 
applauses, such as</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As opposed to a certain company, I didn't have to send an email to my 
employees to tell them security is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, and funny.</p>
<p>The next guest was SalesForce.com's CEO, introduced by Scott as &quot;the fastest 
growing company in Silicon Valley ever&quot; (really?!?).</p>
<p>This demo was again not extremely convincing:&nbsp; a boring portal which 
stumped the boisterous CEO several times, requiring the assistance of a 
technician to come on stage and click on &quot;Login&quot;.&nbsp; I am not quite sure what 
they were trying to illustrate, except for the massive use of applets (so 
nineties).</p>
<p>That's pretty much it.&nbsp; Let me repeat that the keynote was extremely 
enjoyable and Sun's recent setbacks seem to have made Scott more humble and 
apparently more willing to fight than ever.&nbsp; Hopefully, a bigger and better 
Sun will come out of it.</p>
