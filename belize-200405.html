<h3>
General information</h3>
<p>
We landed in Belize City and took a small charter plane from there to Ambergris 
Caye (pronounced “key”), an island off the coast of the main land where most of 
the scuba diving in Belize takes place. The charter we took contained about 
fifteen people and is a great way to get an overview of the area (and of the 
plane’s dashboard as well). <p>
<div class="float-right">

</div>
Two airlines connect Belize City (main land) to San Pedro:&nbsp; Mayan Island 
Airlines and Tropic.&nbsp; We used Mayan Island and they forgot to load one of 
my bags on the way back, which was quite unfortunate.&nbsp; The airstrip is 
pretty small so if you get a chance, make sure that all your bags get loaded on 
the plane to avoid this kind of problem... 
<p>Ambergris Caye is a small island whose main city, San Pedro, features streets 
that are covered by sand. The main transportation is golf carts and bicycles. It 
is quite underdeveloped although the modernity of some shops contrast starkly 
with the overall poor shape of the city. There are two Internet cafés there, 
which was quite a pleasant surprise (I recommend the Caribbean Connection, which 
is run by a couple of very nice Bulgarians. And they serve good coffee too).</p>
<p>
<p>
The currency in Belize is the Belizean dollar, which equals to half a US dollar. 
In Ambergris Caye, both dollars are accepted at that rate but you will usually 
get your change in Belizean dollars unless you ask otherwise. English is the 
prevalent language but natives typically speak between themselves in Creole 
(although Spanish also seems fairly popular). The cuisine is a mix of Mexican, 
American and Caribbean and the restaurants offer prices ranging from $10 to $25 
per person. You can also find a few holes in a wall that will serve you 
delicious tostadas for $2 or just buy grilled chicken from barbeques on the 
street for about that much.<p>
<p>
One note of warning: it is not recommended to drink tap water in Belize. I am 
just repeating what I was told and it’s probably exaggerated a bit, but why take 
the risk of ruining your entire trip when you can stay on the safe side for a 
few extra dollars per day… Besides, this is an excellent excuse for cranking up 
your margarita consumption.<p>
<p>
The main city in Ambergris Caye is San Pedro and even though the distances are 
pretty small, I recommend making sure your hotel is within a ten-minute walk 
from downtown. It gets really hot during the day and you will only want to beat 
the scorching streets for so long to get where the action is.<p>
<p>
The first hotel we stayed at, Sunbreeze, is at the Southern part of the downtown 
area and at a walking distance from the airport (note that the airport is so 
tiny that noise from planes was never an issue). <p>
<p>
We went through three different hotels during our stay (Sunbreeze, Aquamarina 
and Bayan Bay, which is further South from downtown), all of them quite 
adequate.<p>
<p>
Despites its pronounced American influence, Belize borrows more from the 
European/Mexican lifestyle than the American one, so shops typically close 
during lunch, on Sundays and at 8pm. Even our hotel lobbies were closed at night 
with no phone number we could call after hours, so make sure you keep your key 
with you when you walk out at night.<p>
<p>
We were disappointed to find out that there is pretty much no beach front in San 
Pedro at all. It’s a short sandy area bordered by hotel limits and piers. You 
will find a couple of volleyball courts, though, but don’t expect to set up a 
football game. The shallow water doesn’t lend itself to aquatic games either 
since its bottom is mostly covered by weeds right from the beach.<p>
<p>
In spite of its isolated status, Ambergris Caye is very well supplied with all 
kinds of groceries and facilities, so you shouldn’t worry about finding basic 
items should you forget to have packed any. One glaring exception to this is 
underwater cameras: you will not find a disposable underwater camera capable of 
going under 55 feet on the island. Luckily, we had brought a 95-foot underwater 
camera with us, but if I had known, I would have bought a second one.<p>
<p>
Once we settled in the hotel, we quickly registered with the dive shop to get an 
idea of what expects us. There are several packages you can get there, and the 
one we picked included ten dives (you are free to use them at your own pace; we 
typically dove twice a day to free our afternoon). <p>
<p>
Some additional diving activities I recommend include:<p>
<ul>
	<li>Night dives</li>
	<li>The Blue Hole</li>
	<li>Ray Shark Alley and Hol Chan</li>
	<li>Lamanai ruins</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
<p>
I’ll address those in turn.<p>
<h3>
Diving</h3>
	<p>
<p>
Ambergris Caye features a reef on its East Coast that is the second longest in 
the world (160 miles), right behind the Australian Great Barrier Reef. The reef 
can be seen from the shore thanks to the white crest of waves hitting it 
constantly (and the distinct change in color the sea takes beyond it). The boat 
ride to local dive sites is typically anywhere between ten and twenty-five 
minutes and operators will pick you up on the pier in front of your hotel, with 
all the gear that you rented and your tanks set up and ready to go.<p>
<p>
You will pretty much be doing drift dives exclusively, although the current is 
softer than Cozumel. The dive profiles are fairly similar: the maximum depth is 
usually in the 90-100 feet range and features amazing corrals and swim throughs. 
The aquatic population is what you would expect in the Caribbean: nurse sharks, 
moray eels, turtles, various rays (which you can sometimes see directly from the 
pier, swimming lazily in two feet of water), etc…<p>
<p>
The local dives I liked most are Cypress Gardens and Victoria Tunnel. Some of 
the others that we dove are: Tres Cocos, Esmeralda, Tuffy Canyon, Cypress 
Tunnel, etc…<p>
<h3>

</table>

There are two atolls southeast of Ambergris Caye: Turneffe Island and Lighthouse 
Reef , where the Blue Hole is located. It is a collapsed volcano situated sixty 
miles southeast of San Pedro and it was explored and made popular by 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau in the seventies. <p>
<p>

The boat will pick you up at around 5:30am and it takes a couple of hours to get 
there, via Cayes Caulker, another small and uninteresting island south of 
Ambergris Caye.<p>
<p>
The Blue Hole is about 1000 feet wide and 420 feet deep. The dive will take you 
to the maximum allowed depth for recreational diving: 130 feet. It is an 
advanced dive and not to be undertaken lightly.<p>
<p>
The profile is as follows: you drop at thirty feet on a sandy bottom, which then 
slopes down at 45 degrees to the edge of the volcano. Then you drop along the 
wall and swim under until you reach 130 feet. The maximum bottom time for this 
dive is eight minutes, and the total dive time is about twenty-five minutes, 
including a five-minute safety stop (you will have two more dives to do on this 
excursion, hence the conservative figures).<p>
<p>
The biggest problem on this dive is equalizing. Not only are you diving deep, 
but you are getting there fast, so if you tend to have equalizing problem, make 
sure you notify your divemaster early and he will take special care of you. 
However, if he fails to take you to the bottom with the rest of the group in 
time, you will be asked to surface and wait there. There is no unaccompanied 
diving in the Blue Hole.<p>
<p>
If you make it down, you will be treated to the sight of impressive stalactites 
and stalagmites, which have accreted there for thousands of years before the 
crater collapsed. It’s the closest you can come to cave-diving without being 
cave-certified. Sea life is not absent, and you will see entire schools of 
Caribbean Reef sharks and also Bull sharks, which are quite different from the 
Nurse sharks we have seen so far.<p>
<p>

</div>
Another note of caution: be aware of nitrogen narcosis. As in all dives below 100 feet, 
there is a distinct possibility of you suffering from this, and as a matter of 
fact, it happened to me during that dive. I was at 130 feet and I started 
feeling a bit “loopy”. I immediately ascended a few feet while trying hard to do 
so at a safe pace, but I can’t say I was very successful at that. The narcosis 
eventually subsided at 120 feet, which I made my new depth for the rest of the 
dive. Remember: nitrogen narcosis is not dangerous in itself, but it impairs 
your judgment and you might make a bad decision under its effect, the worst one 
being ascending too fast.<p>
<p>
If you are not very experienced, I strongly recommend diving the blue hole in 
the strictest buddy terms: hold hands with your buddy and don’t let go. Make 
sure they are aware of the symptoms of nitrogen narcosis and that they won’t let 
you ascend too fast if you become intoxicated. If you respect these simple 
guidelines, you will enjoy your experience greatly and there is no doubt that 
these eight minutes inside the volcano will stay etched in your memory for a 
very long time.<p>
<p>
After this dive, the boat will take you to two more locations in Half-Moon Caye 
for two beautiful wall dives towering above a 3000-foot deep abyss. Lunch will 
take place in an isolated island where a bird observatory has been set up, but 
where I actually enjoyed more looking at giant hermit crabs and iguanas…<p>
<p>
You will be back in Ambergris Caye at around 5pm, ready to relax before 
celebrating your extreme diving with a few margaritas.<p>
<p>
The Blue Hole excursion is not cheap but I definitely recommend it, not just for 
the first dive, but for the overall feeling of breaking away from Ambergris Caye, 
going on the open ocean for a few hours, diving walls (the second location was 
the best dive of the entire stay for me) and exploring islands lost in the 
middle of the ocean.<p>
<h3>
Night dive</h3>
<p>
<p>
Night diving takes places in Hol Chan Cut, which is one of the openings in the 
reef, south of San Pedro. It’s a shallow dive (no more than forty feet) and a 
great opportunity to see some unusual sea life. Even if you’ve never dived at 
night, be assured that it’s a fairly easy experience, and even though you won’t 
help feeling nervous in the first few minutes, all worries will soon dissipate 
once you have submerged and you resume your familiar patterns underwater.<p>
<p>
You will find a lot of Eagle rays sleeping on the bottom, giving you a great 
opportunity to lie down on the sand and get a very close look at these amazing 
animals. I was also lucky to be treated to a Spotted Eel, which suddenly 
unfurled its colorful outstretched body right in front of me. It disappeared so 
fast that I blamed myself for not reacting quick enough, but luckily for me, it 
trapped itself in a corner of the reef, forcing itself to make its way back to 
me.<p>
<p>
I was able to take a couple of pictures as it quickly snapped by, still giving 
me a pretty good view of its impressive row of teeth. Later, I also spotted a 
puffer fish (quite a funny fish to observe) and a small octopus, nested deep in 
a crack of the reef.<p>
<h3>
Ray Shark Alley</h3>
	<p>
<p>
Fishermen used to dump their unused catches at this location, which quickly 
became a popular feeding ground for all kinds of sea life and in particular, 
Eagle rays and Nurse sharks. It is a snorkeling location mostly made of a sandy 
bottom, ideal to spend some surface time in-between dives. The rays are very 
friendly and you can safely touch them as long as you limit your contact to soft 
brushes (no wrestling or grabbing).<p>
<h3>
Hol Chan</h3>
	<p>
<p>
Hol Chan is another snorkeling spot, not far from Ray Shark Alley, but its 
profile is a bit different: it’s a canyon that goes down to thirty feet 
featuring corals and reef similar to those you see scuba diving. The shallow 
depth will only allow you to see a fraction of what you see at sixty feet and 
deeper, but it’s a good way to give snorkelers a glimpse of what awaits them in 
the depths.<p>
<h3>
Lamanai</h3>
	<p>
<p>
Lamanai is a Mayan site that was populated by natives between 2500 BC and 1800 
AD. It is the longest pre-classic site recorded and its longevity can be 
attributed to its privileged location (by a river), which allowed it to outlast 
the many other sites that Belize has to offer, and which eventually declined 
because of malnutrition, droughts, etc…<p>
<p>
<div class="float-right">
<img border="0" src="belize-200405_files/image003.jpg" width="409" height="307">
</div>
Since Lamanai is on the main land, the trip to get there from Ambergris Caye is 
a long one, so the best way to enjoy this day-long excursion is to enjoy the 
journey as much as the visit of the ruins. The boat picks you up at 7am and it 
takes about one hour to reach the main land. You enter a river bordered by lush 
mangroves and the guide will most likely slow down to give you a chance to spot 
birds, bats and maybe crocodiles if you are lucky and if the waters are not too 
warm for them yet (which unfortunately is the case in May, so plan to go to 
Belize a few months earlier if you want to see crocodiles).<p>
<p>
You travel on the river for about six miles and reach a remote village that 
doesn’t have running water nor electricity (they do have gift shops, of course). 
A bus is waiting for you there and it’s another hour on the unpaved roads of the 
Belizean back country until you reach another boat, which will cover the final 
leg of your trip to the ruins (approximately ninety minutes).<p>
<div class="float-left">
<img border="0" src="belize-200405_files/image005.jpg" width="410" height="307">
</div>
Lamanai features the tallest temple of all pre-classic sites: 100 feet (which, 
added to the 150 feet above the water the site is already at, gives you a 
breathtaking view of your surroundings if you can make it to the top). The climb 
is pretty steep, but it’s worth the work out.<p>
<p>
Be aware that the temperature in the jungle will be a few degrees higher than 
what you experience in Ambergris Caye, and the moisture is guaranteed to make 
you sweat profusely during the tour. Make sure you stay hydrated and be ready 
for murderous onslaughts of mosquitoes, which will eat you alive unless you have 
come prepared.<p>
<p>
Also, keep your camera ready at all time since the live jungle is a good stage 
for unexpected appearances of various animals. We spotted a family of hollering 
monkeys during the tour (which are pretty easy to lure with leaves). Tarantulas 
are also very common in the jungle and if your guide is experimented, he will 
easily nudge one out of its hiding for a quick snapshot (this is not for the 
faint of heart since your average tarantula spans six to eight inches, but they 
are absolutely harmless to humans and quite gorgeous animals).<p>
<h3>
Prices</h3>
	<p>
<p>
Here are the prices we found at the time of this writing (May 2004), in US 
dollars:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Single tank: $45</li>
		<li>Second and third tank: $40</li>
		<li>Night dive: $45</li>
		<li>Blue hole: $185</li>
		<li>Snorkeling: $30</li>
		<li>Rental gear: $8 a piece (regulator, wet suit, BC, light, etc…)</li>
		<li>Blue Hole excursion: $180</li>
		<li>Internet: $7.5 an hour</li>
		<li>Golf carts: $45 for eight hours or $60 for twenty-four hours (I recommend 
gas-propelled cars, you never know how good an electric battery is, and you 
don’t want to break down far out of town). A golf cart tour is a good way to 
kill a few hours if you don’t have anything better to do, but be aware that the 
unique road on the northern part of the island is very bumpy and, unfortunately, 
doesn’t offer much to see.</li>
		<li>Hotels downtown will cost you about $100 a night but the prices drop 
dramatically if you get a dive package, so make sure you get one. Also, we 
noticed once we got there that our tour operator had taken a hefty $100 over the 
price we would have paid if we had contacted our hotel directly (Aquamarina), so 
tour operators might not be your best option. Take the time to make a few direct 
phone calls to those hotels and to do some research on the web.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
<p>
These prices seem pretty much fixed for the entire city, and even some haggling 
didn’t bring them down, although it never hurts to try (it was more effective in 
Cozumel).<p>
