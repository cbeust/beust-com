<h1 align="center">Scuba diving in Cozumel</h1>
<p align="right"><i>Cedric Beust, January 2003</i></p>
<p>I am just back from a one-week scuba diving trip to Cozumel, here is quick 
summary of my vacation.</p>
<p>Cozumel is a small island off the coast of Mexico in the Caribbean sea 
(Cancun is just across the water, you can see the main land from the island).&nbsp; 
Cozumel also has the reputation of being one of the finest scuba diving spots of 
the planet.&nbsp; I haven't dived enough around the globe to concur, but I can 
definitely say that diving in Cozumel had a huge impact on me.</p>
<p><b>Pictures</b></p>
<p>The few pictures I took at the surface can be found
<a href="http://home.beust.com/cedric/priv/0301-cozumel/default.htm">here</a> 
but I am hoping the underwater pictures we took will be much more interesting.&nbsp; 
Hopefully, they will be developed soon (nudge to Anise).</p>
<p><b>Scuba diving</b></p>
<p>The west coast of the island is where all the scuba diving takes places.&nbsp; 
There are more than twenty spots indicated on the map, and I'm sure you can go 
through these several times and still enjoy your dives.&nbsp; You will typically 
have two dives in the morning and one in the afternoon, which is guaranteed to 
saturate your body with nitrogen for the rest of the day, but it's absolutely 
worth it.</p>
<p>Our dives were all in the forty-ninety feet range.&nbsp; I wouldn't recommend 
to dive deeper since it will probably bring down your number of dives for the 
day to two, and I haven't really seen a point in diving deeper than ninety feet 
(I am not aware of wrecks in the area).&nbsp; The visibility is never a problem, 
even when the weather is bad (I would say it varies between forty feet and at 
least a hundred feet with a good weather).</p>
<p>Note that the weather can go bad in Cozumel (and it actually did during our 
trip).&nbsp; Depending on the season or the proximity of a hurricane, strong 
winds might sweep the land and cause the port to close, which means no diving 
for anyone.&nbsp; It is very frustrating when it happens, so I would recommen 
you plan your holiday carefully season-wise (obviously, there's not much you can 
do about hurricanes).</p>
<p>The water temperature is amazingly constant, even at eighty feet of depth:&nbsp; 
between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24-27 degrees centigrade).&nbsp; You will 
typically wear a 2-3 mil shorty or a skin.&nbsp; You don't need gloves nor a 
hood, but I have seen a few divers be more conservative and wear full body suits 
(still no thicker than 2-3 millimeters, though).&nbsp; Keep in mind that Cozumel 
is a National Park, and that you should touch the reef under no circumstances, 
nor pick up any kind of souvenir.&nbsp; &quot;Se admira, pero non se toca&quot;.</p>
<p>A typical dive day looks like this:&nbsp; the boat picks you up at 8:30 am 
and then takes about one hour to get to the first dive spot, South of your 
location.&nbsp; After your dive, it heads back North toward the hotel, stops at 
the second dive spot and waits for you to have a one hour surface time.&nbsp; 
You do your second dive, and then head for the hotel for a quick lunch.&nbsp; 
Some dive packages will allow you to do an afternoon dive, which is usually done 
no later than 3pm.</p>
<p>All the dives are drift dives, which can be very exciting.&nbsp; Nothing will 
ever come closer to the impression of flying than hovering twenty feet above the 
reef and staring down as the landscape passes you by.&nbsp; It's also a good 
exercise in buoyancy control if you happen to have an underwater camera with you 
(something I recommend for every single dive.&nbsp; A dive light is also a good 
thing to have with you, even during the day).</p>
<p>Both the aquatic life and the relief are great things to explore in Cozumel.&nbsp; 
The reef is interspersed with corridors and caves that are very easy to swim 
through, even if you are not comfortable with closed spaces.&nbsp; Another 
exhilarating experience is diving along a cliff wall, such as the Santa Rosa 
wall.&nbsp; Don't bother trying to locate the bottom, though, since it is about 
two thousand feet below you.&nbsp; Yup, it's deep and dark down there.&nbsp; 
Keep a close eye on your depth, your group and your ears so you always know how 
deep you exactly are.&nbsp; Once you are comfortable, I have no doubts that 
images from the movie &quot;The Abyss&quot; will flash before your eyes.</p>
<p>As for the aquatic life, you will pretty much encounter everything you would 
expect:&nbsp; psychedelic fish, monster lobsters, slick eels, sting rays and 
spotted eagle rays, carefree sharks, frightened octopuses (octopii?&nbsp; :-)), 
intriguing sea horses, majestic turtles, etc...&nbsp; You name it.</p>
<p><b>Tourism</b></p>
<p>Currency and language are never a problem in Cozumel:&nbsp; everyone in the 
touristy areas speak fluent English and dollars can be used to pay for 
everything.&nbsp; The change rate seems to be constant across the island:&nbsp; 
one dollar for ten pesos.&nbsp; It is perfectly okay to pay a fifty pesos bill 
with forty pesos and one dollar.&nbsp; You can also get cash from the ATM's, but 
I am not sure it's that useful</p>
<p>Be ready to bargain.&nbsp; Shop owners might be reluctant at first but we 
have been able to get cheaper prices pretty much every single time we tried.&nbsp; 
Some of them even ran after us after we left the store to agree with what we 
were offering.&nbsp; Also, the sea front shops are the most expensive.&nbsp; 
Don't hesitate to walk a few blocks inside the town and you will find store 
owners more open to negotiating prices.</p>
<p>There are a few ruins on the island, such as San Gervasio, but I would only 
recommend visiting them if you have nothing else to do (say, the port is closed 
and you can't dive :-)).&nbsp; The best and cheaper way to get there is probably 
to rent a scooter.&nbsp; The typical price is $25-$30, but we got ours for $20, 
which was probably too much anyway since it broke down (lucky us, we were parked 
in our hotel parking lot, and the owner refunded us completely, something I 
didn't expect).</p>
<p>There are a lot of hotels in Cozumel and for a better experience, you should 
make sure with the diving shop that they will be picking you up not too far from 
your hotel (we were staying at the Brisas hotel, which was a perfect choice 
since not only do they have a pier across the street, but this is usually the 
last stop that boats make before heading for the dive spot).</p>
<p><b>Miscellaneous remarks</b></p>
<p>I was very impressed with the professionalism exerted by the divemasters who 
were accompanying us.&nbsp; It shows in a lot of subtle ways, but there is no 
denying about the fact that they know their jobs very well.&nbsp; First of all, 
they are always looking for things of interest to show you, and they will bring 
tools with them to attract your attention when they spot something worth your 
attention (typically, hitting a metallic object on their tank).&nbsp; Some of 
them will bring a wooden stick to poke the lobsters and crabs so that they get 
out of their hide out for a minute, and they are indeed quite a sight.</p>
<p>Also, they were clearly watching every one of us very carefully during our 
dives and they were prolific with personalized advice to all of us once we were 
back on the boat (one thing that I learned:&nbsp; I kick too much, a habit I 
took in Monterey).</p>
<p>During one of our last dives, Anise's BC broke down:&nbsp; the hose connected 
to the inflating mechanism was leaking air and there was no way to fix it.&nbsp; 
I switched BC with her and it turned out to be a very interesting drill in 
buoyancy control.&nbsp; Not being able to inflate your BC with your tank is not 
really a problem in warm water since you are typically carrying about ten pounds 
of weight, which is not really enough to threaten your life on the surface (you 
can always dump your weight belt anyway).&nbsp; However, it was interesting to 
adjust my buoyancy at the bottom by having to manually inflate my BC instead of 
simply using my tank.&nbsp; It was also a good way to practice the final stage 
of an emergency swimming ascent at the surface, especially in rough waters (the 
waves were about two feet high).</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Every single time I was diving, I was thinking &quot;They didn't tell me <b>that</b> 
when I got certified&quot;.&nbsp; And as a matter of fact, if your only diving 
experience has been in cold waters (Monterey for me), your first dive in the 
warm waters of the Caribbean sea will be a shock.&nbsp; Nothing can really 
prepare you for the feeling of exhilaration that this experience will procure 
you.&nbsp; You will feel unique, like you're on top of the world and there is no 
limit to what you can do.&nbsp; Being weightless and swimming through these 
extraordinary landscapes sent shivers down my spine, and I can't close my eyes 
without getting flashes of the time I spent down there.</p>
