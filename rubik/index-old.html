  Cedric Beust</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/cbeust">@cbeust</a>), January 2003</p>

<h2 align="left">Foreword</h2>
<p align="left">A couple of weeks ago at a party, I came in contact with a 
Rubik's cube.&nbsp; It's not that I hadn't seen one in a long time (my very own 
faithful cube has been in my possession for over twenty years now), but for some 
reason, playing with that one revived in me the will to solve it again.</p>
<p align="left">I used to be crazy about the Rubik's cube, back in high school 
something like twenty years ago.&nbsp; We were running contests and I was able 
to solve it in a minute overall.&nbsp; Not stellar, but decent.&nbsp; There was 
one major difference, though:&nbsp; back then, we didn't have the Internet.&nbsp; 
I had gotten my solution in various magazines and I had added my own maneuvers 
in an attempt to speed up the process and beat my classmates.</p>
<p align="left">When I looked it up on the Internet, I wasn't really surprised 
to find a wealth of information.&nbsp; Much more than anything I had ever read 
on the topic.&nbsp; There are all kinds of methodologies out there and a lot of 
people who took the time to put up Web pages have used various ways to reach 
their own solution, often assisted by a computer (see the links section below 
for details).</p>
<p align="left">But at this point, I'm not really interested in speed cubing.&nbsp; 
I just want a solution that's easy to memorize so I can revive the old feeling 
of beating the cube without reading a paper.&nbsp; None of the solutions I read 
were really aimed at easy memorization, so I created this page.</p>
<p align="left">You 
will find out that the first half of this solution is simple common sense and even though I took 
the trouble of enumerating each maneuver for the sake of completeness, you only need to 
memorize the maneuvers explained in the second part of this solution.&nbsp; I am confident 
that the first part will stick with you since I remembered how to get that part 
myself even after twenty years of inactivity.</p>
<p align="left">Therefore, I split this solution in two parts:&nbsp; the easy 
one (in which you build the first two layers except for one edge) and the harder 
one, where you complete the cube using more complex maneuvers that you need to 
learn by heart.</p>
<p align="left">As as side note, I focused on providing the maneuvers that you 
absolutely need to know in order to finish the cube (a total of eight 
maneuvers).&nbsp; For every step of the second part, you can find on the Web 
similar maneuvers that will solve this stage when the cubies are in different 
locations.&nbsp; I didn't include them in this solution so you are not 
overwhelmed or discouraged by the amount of what you need to learn, but once you 
are familiar with the maneuvers below to the point where you no longer need to 
think, I strongly recommend you follow the links I provide at the end of this 
page:&nbsp; they will teach you more specialized maneuvers that will greatly 
speed up your cube solving.</p>

<p align="left">As a final thought, it is just amazing how finger memory works.&nbsp; 
It took me a couple of hours of practice to have this solution totally memorized 
in my fingers.&nbsp; No more thinking in terms of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;R prime&quot;, it just 
comes automatically.&nbsp; Give it a try, practice these maneuvers over and over 
(even on an unmade cube), and you will learn it in no time.</p>


<h2 align="left">Notation</h2>
<p align="left">I am using the popular notation that I found pretty much 
everywhere.&nbsp; Each side is represented by its initial:&nbsp; Front, Back, 
Left, Right, Up, Down.&nbsp; A letter by itself (e.g. &quot;R&quot;) means &quot;turn this side 
clockwise&quot;.&nbsp; A letter followed by a prime (e.g. &quot;F'&quot;) means &quot;turn this side 
counter-clockwise.&nbsp; Finally, a letter followed by 2 (e.g. &quot;L2&quot;, it should 
really be a square, not a 2) means &quot;turn this side 180 degrees&quot;.&nbsp; If you 
have any doubts, the applets will clear up any confusion you might feel.</p>
<p align="left">One last note before we begin:&nbsp; I shamelessly stole the 
slick cube applet from Lars, whose Web site you can find in the links section.&nbsp; 
Be sure to check out his Rubik's page, there is a lot of information contained 
there.</p>
<p align="left">And now, let's start.</p>
<h2 align="left">Phase one</h2>
<p align="left">This is the easy part where you could pretty much guess all 
these moves by yourself.&nbsp; Before you can start, you need to pick a side and 
place the edges correctly so that the cube shows a cross.&nbsp; I will skip this 
part because it's trivial, but if you disagree, please let me know and I will 
add a step-by-step description of how to get there.</p>
<h3 align="left">1a) Position three corners</h3>
<p align="left">All four edges are in place, now we want to position three 
corners so that we end up with the first layer finished except for one corner.&nbsp; 
Move a corner under its final position and apply one of the three following 
maneuvers:</p>

      <td width="34%" align="center">F' D2 F D F' D' F</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>

<p>
Note that even though the third maneuver looks intimidating, it's actually quite 
simple:&nbsp; we can't place the corner directly in its final location if it's 
facing downwards, so we move the cube in order to reach one of the first two 
scenarios, which we can then solve.<p>
At the end of this step, your cube will look like this:<br>
&nbsp;<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber9">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" align="center">

</applet></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
We will use this missing corner (also called &quot;working corner&quot;) to install the 
second layer.<h3>
1b) Position three edges in the middle layer</h3>
<p>
Our goal in this phase is to bring the cube with the first two layers complete except for 
one corner and one edge:<br>
&nbsp;<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber8">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%" align="center">
<applet code="lrubik.class" width="125" height="145">
  ?        ?        ?        ?        ?        ?
                                                                                                        LEFT     FRONT    TOP      RIGHT    BOTTOM   BACK     ?
                         ggggggggggggggggggddddddddggggggggggggggggggdgggggggdg<param name="pos" value="ccccccggggggeegeegddgddddddgggbbgbbggggggggggaaaaaagggg"><param name="move" value="">
</applet></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>

To achieve this, we are going to position three middle edge cubies using the 
working corner.&nbsp; For each edge, you have two possible configurations.&nbsp; 
Bring the working corner on top of the edge you want to install, and use one of 
the two following maneuvers:<br>
&nbsp;<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber7">

      <td width="50%" align="center">

      <td width="50%" align="center">

                                                                                                        BACK     FRONT    TOP      RIGHT    BOTTOM   BACK     ?
                         ggggggggggggggggggddddddddggggggggggggggggggdgggggggdg<param name="pos" value="gggggggggggggeggegddgddddddgggbbebbggegbggggggggggggggg"><param name="move" value="F1D3F3">

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td width="50%" align="center">L D' L'</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>

Repeat these maneuvers for the three cubies until you reach the point where the two layers are finished except for one corner and the edge below it.  Then use 
the maneuvers shown in 1a) to position the final corner of the first layer.&nbsp; 
Your cube should now look like this:<br>
&nbsp;<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber6">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" align="center">

<applet code="lrubik.class" width="125" height="145">
  ?        ?        ?        ?        ?        ?
                                                                                                        LEFT     FRONT    TOP      RIGHT    BOTTOM   BACK     ?
                         ggggggggggggggggggddddddddggggggggggggggggggdgggggggdg<param name="pos" value="ccccccggggggeegeeedddddddddbggbbgbbggggggggggaaaaaagggg"><param name="move" value="">
</applet></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>

From this point on, we're going to need formulas to finish the cube.&nbsp; Until 
then, all the maneuvers were pretty straightforward and you can even 
reconstitute them yourself, but you are going to have to memorize what follows 
from this point on.<h2>

Phase 2</h2>
<h3>

2a) Finish the middle layer</h3>
<p>

Turn the cube around and bring the missing edge near its final position.&nbsp; 
Depending on where the missing edge is, use one of the two following maneuvers:<br>
&nbsp;<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber5">

<h3>

2b) Orient the edges on the last layer</h3>
<p>

Now we only have one layer left.&nbsp; The first step is to orient all four 
edges correctly.&nbsp; The following maneuvers take care of orienting pairs of 
edges, either adjacent, or opposed:<br>
&nbsp;<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber4">

<h3>

2c) Position the edges</h3>
<p>

Now that the edges are oriented correctly, we need to put them in their final 
location.&nbsp; The following maneuver switches the two edges opposed to you:<br>

<h3>2d) Position the corners</h3>
<p>We are done with the edges.&nbsp; Next, we need to position the corners to their final position (not necessarily 
well oriented).&nbsp; The following maneuver leaves the corner at the northwest 
corner untouched but rotates the other three counter-clockwise.&nbsp; You might 
have to make this maneuver several times until you have placed all four corners.</p>

2e) Orient the corners</h3>
<p>

And finally, we orient the last corners.&nbsp; This maneuver is a bit particular 
since it's going to mess up the cube as long as we are not done with all the 
corners.&nbsp; The idea is to bring the corner you want to orient in front of you, 
as shown below.&nbsp; Depending on what side you need to adjust, use one of the 
two following maneuvers (named respectively <em>2e</em> and <em>2e'</em>).&nbsp; Once you are done, you will notice that the 
corner is now in its final location, but the rest of the cube seems messed up.&nbsp; 
It's not.&nbsp; Rotate the up layer to bring the next corner you want to work 
on, and repeat the maneuver.&nbsp; When you are done with the last corner, the 
cube will magically be solved.</p>
<p>
<p>
There is an additional gotcha with this final maneuver, which was pointed out by Jonathan Felder (thanks a lot, Jonathan!):  you need to make sure that you execute as many <em>2e</em> as <em>2e'</em>.  Failing to do that will result in the final side solved but the rest of the cube messed up.
<p>
For example, one possible scenario is that you have three corners left that need to be oriented.  If your cube is in a solvable state, it can apparently be solved with either (2e U 2e U 2e) or (2e' U 2e' U 2e').  This won't work, so instead, you will need to use something like (2e'2e' U 2e U 2e) or (2e2e U 2e' U 2e') in order to even out the number of 2e and 2e'.
</p>
Here are 2e and 2e' (notice that 2e2e = 2e' and 2e'2e' = 2e).

Since this is a bit tricky, let's look at an example.&nbsp; The cube below has 
two corners that need to be oriented.&nbsp; The first six moves correspond to 
the second maneuver above, and they fix the corner facing us.&nbsp; Then I 
rotate the up layer twice in order to bring the second mis-oriented corner 
facing me, and I apply the first maneuver (since this time, the yellow part is 
facing me).</p>

<h3>2e) Orient the corners (contributed by Junhua Wang)</h3>

To orient the corners, you only need to memorize one formula: R F' R' F.

<p>

Bring the corner to orient in the top right position and run this formula over and over again until the corner has the right orientation. Then move the upper layer to bring the next corner in the top right position and repeat.

<p>

In the example above, we had to run the formula twice to orient the first corner. Then we rotate the top side to bring the next corner in position. This one requires three formulas to put it in place. Then we rotate the top back.

Other Rubik's cube links</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.puzzlesolver.com/seqential/rubik/cube/index.shtml">
  Puzzle Solver Web site</a> is where I took most of the phase two maneuvers.&nbsp; 
  Their first phase differs slightly from mine, but you should check it out if 
  you want to speed up your cube resolution as it supplies additional maneuvers 
  to solve some of the stages.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="http://lar5.com/cube/">Lars</a> is the author of the cube applet 
  that I used in these pages and his solution is geared toward speed cubing.&nbsp; 
  It is a layered solution but he uses different means and maneuvers to solve 
  the two layers.&nbsp; I found his solution a little harder to follow because 
  there are a lot of assumptions in-between the stages, but once you understand 
  it, you will no doubt cut down your cube solving time dramatically.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://kociemba.org/cube.htm">Cube Explorer</a> 
  is an amazing program that will solve any given Rubik's cube in an average of 
  twenty moves (most of the time, less than that).&nbsp; It is in average just 
  three moves above the theoretical optimal solution and it uses brute forces to 
  reach that result.&nbsp; Amazing.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html">Jessica Fridrich's page</a> is the ultimate resource for speed cubing.  A lot of formulas to remember, but if you can pull it off, your times will probably drop below the thirty second barrier.</li>
</ul>
<p>

There are many other pages available and I won't enumerate them all here since 
Google does a much better job at it.</p>
