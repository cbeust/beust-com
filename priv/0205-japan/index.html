<h1 align="center"><b>Japan 2002</b></h1>
<p>I visited Tokyo and Kyoto for ten days during the &quot;golden week&quot;, a unique 
week during the year when the Japanese enjoy numerous days off.&nbsp; This page 
gathers some pictures and thoughts gathered during my trip.</p>
<p>Before going further, I must extend a very special thanks to Mami, who 
organized this trip for me and endured my countless questions on her language in 
general and Kanji in particular.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Mami, I owe you 
memories, the most precious gift.</p>
<h2><b>Kyoto</b></h2>
<p>Monday at 5am, we enter the metro, change at Shinjuku station and board the 
Shinkansen bound to Kyoto.&nbsp; Three hours total and peak speeds of 400 km/h 
(not the fastest line, the record is 443 km/h).&nbsp; We reach Kyoto station at 
10 o'clock, have our bags sent to our Ryokan and start visiting.&nbsp; The 
schedule is busy, but in the two days we spent in Kyoto, we managed to visit the 
following places:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="kinkakuji.html">Kinkaku-ji</a></li>
  <li><a href="ryozen-kannon.html">Ryozen Kannon</a></li>
  <li><a href="kyomizudera.html">Kyomizudera</a></li>
  <li><a href="gingakuji.html">Gingaku-ji</a></li>
  <li><a href="ryoanji.html">Ryoan-ji</a></li>
  <li><a href="nijojo.html">Nijo-jo</a></li>
  <li><a href="sanju-sangen-do.html">Sanju-sangen-do</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of walking, even for a seasoned golfer (although I was also 
fighting a nasty virus during the whole week, which didn't help keep my energy 
at its usual level).&nbsp; What's amazing about Kyoto is that all the temples 
and castles are scattered within the city.&nbsp; No need to take a lengthy trip, 
all you need is a bus map and some patience (or some knowledge in Hiragana) in 
order to find your way.&nbsp; Good ears help too, as the destinations are 
usually announced on the buses.</p>
<p>We spent two nights in a <a href="ryokan.html">Ryokan</a>, which is a 
traditional Japanese hotel.&nbsp; This part of the trip in itself was a 
wonderful and enlightening experience, and I recommend it to anyone interested 
in discovering more about the Japanese culture (take note of the warnings I put 
in the link, though).</p>
<p>Tuesday night, we took the Shinkansen back to Tokyo and we stopped in Atami, 
a little sea resort one hour from Tokyo which has the particularity of having a 
lot of hot springs (&quot;onsen&quot;).&nbsp; Consequently, most of the hotels and ryokans 
feature public baths tapping directly in these hot springs.</p>
<h2><b>Tokyo</b></h2>
<p>Tokyo features a lot of very different neighborhoods, all with their unique 
features.&nbsp; Since we had had our share of temples and castles in Kyoto, we 
focused more on idle walking during our stay there, in an effort to &quot;take in&quot; 
the buzzing and never-resting atmosphere of the capital.&nbsp; We took a stroll 
in </p>
<ul>
  <li>Shinjuku, the high-tech nerve point with tall buildings covered with giant 
  screens, in the purest Blade Runner style</li>
  <li>Ebisu</li>
  <li>Akihabara, geeks paradise (imagine Fry's spreading on several blocks and 
  streets)</li>
  <li>Shibuya</li>
  <li>Omotesando</li>
  <li>Harajuku</li>
  <li>Azabu</li>
  <li>Akasaka</li>
  <li>Ikebukuro</li>
  <li>Asakusa, which hosts <a href="kaminarimon.JPG">Kaminarimon</a> and also a little 
  <a href="park.html">amusement park</a> in Hanayashiki completely overcrowded on weekends.&nbsp; 
  Another interesting curiosity is the <a href="asahi.html">Asahi building</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="ginza.JPG">Ginza</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On Friday night, I had the rare privilege to attend <a href="kabuki.JPG">Kabuki</a>.&nbsp; It's a very 
old Japanese play that Japanese connoisseurs love (and that most Japanese are 
absolutely not interested in, as I found out).&nbsp; For historic reasons, only 
male actors are allowed on stage, which forces some of them to specialize in 
female (<i>onnagata) </i>and young kid roles.&nbsp; Kabuki's are extremely long 
(4-5 hours is pretty common) and often feature several sections.&nbsp; The crowd 
also participates in the play by shouting the names of the actors (or the house 
they belong to) to encourage them, or simply to express their satisfaction.</p>
<p>Kabukis are usually very slow in the development of the plot and sometimes 
(but not necessarily) feature dances and songs. We were given earphones that 
explained what was going on on stage as the events unrolled.&nbsp; The plays are 
usually spoken in old Japanese and the plots are often very intricate, which 
explains why quite a few of the Japanese themselves were also wearing these earphones 
(although the explanations were most likely more detailed than the ones we had 
in English).</p>
<p>The play we attended struck me as reasonably modern:&nbsp; a local detective 
decides to investigate a mysterious case of ghosts appearing in a little 
village.&nbsp; Despite all our efforts, we still missed out on some of the 
elements of the plot, even though these were explained in clear terms by the 
main protagonist at the end of the show.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<p>I can't wrap up this summary without sharing some thoughts that I had as I 
was visiting this country that I had been wanted to discover for such a long 
time (not only because I studied Japanese).</p>
<p>I remember that my first contact, as the train approached Tokyo, was that the 
outskirts look a lot like Paris.&nbsp; Europeans won't be extremely surprised by 
the difference, although Americans certainly will.&nbsp; However, the 
resemblance stops there.&nbsp; As soon as you get off the train, you are 
immediately  struck by the density of the crowd and the intense and vibrant 
atmosphere that permeates everything.&nbsp; We got off the train at Shinjuku, 
which might also explain this unmistakable feeling (Shinjuku is the most modern 
neighborhood of Tokyo, where all the new high-tech shops and buildings are 
located).</p>
<p>If you think that housing in San Francisco is expensive, you need to 
experiment Tokyo.&nbsp; The prices have flared up there, and vacancy is still 
very rare.&nbsp; Once you're in the City, getting by is made easy by the very 
dense <a href="http://www.japan.co.jp/~pbw/tokyosub.htm">Subway network</a>, 
coupled by JR (Japan Railway) and also the very convenient Yamanote, a special 
train that circles Tokyo.&nbsp; Pretty much all the names I have come across are 
written in Kanji, spelled in both Hiragana and English (I should say Westerner), 
which makes it relatively easy to find your destinations.&nbsp; I found that my 
knowledge of Hiragana did help me a little to understand where we were going, 
even though Mami was pretty much making the calls every time.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>One word of warning for international travelers:&nbsp; the banking system of 
Japan is very much behind, in the sense that your international credit cards will be <b>
very</b> hard to use.&nbsp; Don't even think of using it in a restaurant.&nbsp; 
ATM's that accept them can only be found in very touristy places (or near the 
main train stations) and expect the instructions and transactions to be painful 
and hard to follow.&nbsp; I did make a purchase of a digital camera in Shinjuku 
with my American card, and it took twenty minutes of waiting to get 
confirmation, including a conversation I had to have over the phone with the 
bank where they asked me my address and even my social security number (you have 
been warned, you need to have it with you).</p>
<p>The best advice I can give you is to withdraw <b>a lot</b> of cash on your 
first day (or even better:&nbsp; before leaving).&nbsp; Life is very expensive 
in Tokyo and it's pretty usual for Japanese to go out with 50,000 yens in their 
pockets for a night out (about $400.&nbsp; Yes, even Japanese credit cards are 
not very much used there).</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Impossible to talk about Japan without mentioning the wireless madness.&nbsp; 
As Mami pointed out to me the first day, &quot;our phones are no longer getting 
smaller, it's the contrary now&quot;.&nbsp; And she's very right.&nbsp; They are not 
getting extremely bulky either, but they do have a reasonable size.&nbsp; The 
main reason is that they all sport a crispy clear and quite wide color screen 
which makes them very close second to our PDA's.&nbsp; The Japanese use their 
wireless phones a lot.&nbsp; In the metro, of course, but also everywhere.&nbsp; 
They write emails and extensively use CC's to organize their lives and keep in 
touch with each other, which is a sad reminder about how America lags behind 
(hardly anyone even knows what SMS is in San Francisco).</p>
<p>The most remarkable thing is that Japanese are quite proficient at writing 
Japanese on the keypad.&nbsp; The typical method of input is Hiragana coupled 
with the completion mechanism that we know and hate here.&nbsp; While the speed 
doesn't come close to an English email (or even a Japanese message spelled in 
Romaji and then completed in Hiragana and then Kanji, as I do with IME on 
Windows), they do send &quot;real&quot; emails with these keypads.&nbsp; iMode (the 
protocol used in Japan) limits those to 5,000 characters, but it's very 
sufficient for the basic needs.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>While I'm on the topic of the language...&nbsp; I arrived in Tokyo with a few 
months worth of Japanese studying (although I hadn't practiced for a few months) 
and a very rudimentary knowledge of Hiragana.&nbsp; By the time the week ended, 
I had become pretty much fluent in reading Hiragana.&nbsp; I'm not saying I was 
reading fast, mind you (more like a 1st grade), but I knew close to a 100% of 
the Hiragana alphabet.&nbsp; It's amazing what immersion will do to you.&nbsp; I 
basically spent every minute studying signs, posters, books, magazines, trying 
to memorize the symbols.&nbsp; I was carrying with me a chart of the alphabet 
for a quick look up when a sign wouldn't sink in.</p>
<p>That's the good news.&nbsp; The bad news is that as my Hiragana was 
progressing, I also received a new insight as to how complex Kanji was.&nbsp; I 
did start to learn (and successfully recognize) some Kanji characters, but my 
success was short-lived:&nbsp; I was then hit fully in the face by Kunyomi and 
Onyomi.&nbsp; I won't go into details, since this will only interest people 
fascinated by Japanese, but suffice to say that knowing a Kanji character is not 
enough to know how to pronounce it, as every Kanji character has two possible 
pronunciations, and only memorizing which one is which will work.</p>
<p>The hard-learned lesson for me was the following:&nbsp; if you are studying 
Japanese, postpone reading and writing as much as you can.&nbsp; Learn how to 
speak and how to understand, or reading will be an exercise in frustration and 
humility.&nbsp; After all, what's the point of being able to put syllables 
together if you can't identify the words they form?&nbsp; Besides, if you know 
how to speak, you can ask around and the need to read is lessened by that much.&nbsp; 
And finally, when you are reaching a decent level at speaking and understanding, 
being able to read will be an incredible reward.&nbsp; Trust me.</p>
<h3>More language</h3>
<p>To end this summary on a funny note, I have to mention Engrish.&nbsp; There 
is an ongoing joke about Japanese having a hard time with English, and you do 
get to see a lot of broken English in Japan.&nbsp; The name itself, Engrish, is 
a joke made on the fact that Japanese doesn't have the sounds &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; (the 
right sound is something in-between).&nbsp; It seems very fashionable to wear 
t-shirts and sweaters sporting English (or other languages) sentences.&nbsp; 
The funny part is that very often, there is a blatant mistake in the slogan, 
sometimes written in big bold letters.&nbsp; A quick example would be &quot;United we 
stands&quot;.&nbsp; Here are two other occurrences that totally cracked us up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="engrish.JPG">sign</a> posted in the train station<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The <a href="engrish%20(2).jpg">instructions</a> at our ryokan on the 
  proper use of the public baths.&nbsp; This page is frankly hilarious because 
  it hardly makes any sense.&nbsp; It left us wondering  how they had 
  reached this result, considering that even a software translator would do a 
  better job at it.&nbsp; I felt pretty bad at making fun of our wonderful hosts 
  at the ryokan, so I took the liberty to write a more proper version of this 
  document, which they very kindly accepted.&nbsp; I would appreciate it if ever 
  you end up in that same place to let me know if they replaced their version 
  with ours :-)</li>
