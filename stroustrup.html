&nbsp;

<P><I>Context : the latest ISO/C++ Committee gathered in Sophia Antipolis
a few days ago. The meeting was very "calm", since it was the very first
held since the standard was accepted last November. Bjarne Stroustrup kindly
accepted to make a public presentation before leaving. Here is a short
transcript of what he said.&nbsp;</I>

<P>Stroustrup think that programming languages are not interesting, but
programming is. He started by using Simula but was appalled by the resources
consumed by the existing compilers. He imagined a language that would combine
Simula's elegant OO features with those of a "fast" language (BCPL at that
time).

<P>C++ serves two purposes :
<UL>
<LI>
help humans express ideas (abstraction) ;</LI>

<LI>
efficiently deal with hardware.</LI>
</UL>
Stroustrup doesn't believe in one true language. He thinks that if ever
one day, someone manages to create the perfect language for a given problem,
the said problem will have been long gone when the language is ready to
handle it. With such universal solutions, you usually end up writing 5%
of your application in this language, and the rest in C (or Assembly).

<P>Classes are used to represent concepts. You need to capture relationships
between concepts and between classes. The relationships between concepts
are expressed by parameterized types, and those between classes are represented
by class hierarchies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
CONCRETE TYPES</H3>
Concrete types must be designed very carefully and thoughtfully. A concrete
type is a "small heavily-used abstraction". Concrete types need a minimal
interface. What doesn't fit in the interface should be kept in helper functions.
However, this results in a very loose coupling between the interface and
the functions, thus the crecaion of namespaces in C++. They help maintain
consistency in both the naming and the concepts.

<P>For concrete types, no compromises are needed on conventional notations
runtime space and efficiency
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
CONTAINERS AND GENERIC PROGRAMMING</H3>
Containers must be convenient, efficient and safe. The code must be independant
from the kind of data that is being manipulated. Efficiency has always
been C++' main focus. Bjarne cites an anecdote where an experimental feature
once caused a 3% overhead in the resulting code, and this was deemed unacceptable.
The feature was removed. The containers must be usable for the most demanding
applications.

<P>The approach of the C++ Committee is to use abstract classes and iterators.
There is no reason why an iterator over a list should be very different
from an iterator over a vector. The first solution that appeared was to
use a pure interface for Iterator :
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">template &lt;class T></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">class Iterator {</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">public:</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp; T* first() = 0;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp; T* next() = 0;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">};</FONT></UL>
and then specialize the templates for the various containers. This approach
has the following advantages :
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>+ simple, efficient individual containers
<BR>+ multiple iterator concepts can coexist
<BR>+ type safe
<BR>+ non intrusive (works well with C types)</UL>
but
<UL>- there is an iterator overhead
<BR>- complexity (both in terms of performance -- function call needed
-- and design : this causes an explosive hierarchy of iterators)
<BR>- there is no commpon point for "special" services (e.g. object I/O)</UL>
The oldest approach to this kind of problem is to use a common base class.
It has significant drawbacks, though :
<UL>- overhead (space and time, why inheriting features you won't necessarily
need ?)
<BR>- not type safe (actually, you lose type and must strive to gain it
back through runtime type identification)
<BR>- intrusive (doesn't work with C types)
<BR>- must obey a predetermined pattern, not necessarily suited</UL>
however
<UL>+ special service available in the base class.</UL>
The STL approach solves most of these problems. The requirements are :
<UL>+ it must be simple, efficient for individual containers and iterators
<BR>+ no overhead
<BR>+ type safe
<BR>+ non intrusive</UL>
<B><I>Cedric: at this point, I think Bjarne made a mistake in not pushing
the introduction of the basic concepts of the STL further. The audience
was ready to hear about the STL iterator hierarchy (input, output, forward,
bidirectional, random) and traits, and how they are nicely handled through
templates.</I></B>

<P><B><I>Very recently, I was talking to someone who was puzzled (not to
say appalled) to find out that there were not just "Iterators" in the STL,
but "Const Iterators". While I proceeded in explaining how they both differ
and why they are necessary, I can't help thinking that a gentle introduction
to the problematic makes all this stuff clear and natural. This shouldn't
need to be explained, it should come natural. And I have the feeling that
now would have been the right time for Bjarne to do so.</I></B>

<P><B><I>I suspect that both time constraints and the fact that he didn't
know how C++ aware his audience was made him switch to another gear.</I></B>

<P>Stroustrup then showed the "classical" STL example, that solves the
problem of reading the user's input, sort the words and outputs them. The
listing is less than twenty lines long and was thoroughly explained.

<P><B><I>Cedric: I am not a great fan of this example to illustrate the
STL. I have the feeling most of the people who see it for the first time
will be worried by its compacity and will overlook the main point (which
is : STL allows a great abstraction at almost no cost if compared to a
"manual" solution).</I></B>

<P><B><I>STL Iterators are already a complex notion to grasp for newcomers,
and I am not persuaded that showing their use through stream iterators
is a good idea. After asking a few people around, it turns out they were
not that repelled by the example, so maybe it's just me.</I></B>
<H3>
SPECIALIZATION</H3>
Stroustrup then mentions an important problem that often turns up in template-related
discussions : code bloat. Templates are an incredibly useful tool to capture
abstractions, but if used carelessly, they often cause similar portions
of object code to be replicated throughout compilation units. Bjarne explains
how this can be greately reduced through specialization techniques.

<P><B><I>Cedric: this is admittedly a very important problem and there
are very complex notions at work here (mostly related to : it is necessary
to know what the different template strategies are available in order to
use the one that is most suited to your problem). However, I fail to see
how it fits with Bjarne's overall discussion, mainly focused on high-level
notions. Anyway.</I></B>
<H3>
CLASS HIERARCHIES</H3>
To illustrate this problem, Bjarne takes a very simple example : the user
must type an integer in a window and the program has to retrieve it. Usually,
you will start by defining an abstract interface detailing the miscellaneous
operations to handle the value type by the user (getValue(), hasChanged(),
etc...). Then, when you need to interface with the windowing system, you
can simply make your main class a subclass of the Window class.

<P>However, you are inheriting a lot of uninteresting window implementation
details doing this. This is a general problem with inheritance : the user
should not be bothered by this.

<P>It is necessary to be more loosely coupled to the windowing system.
There are several ways to achieve this, one of them being to use abstract
interfaces and multiply-deriving concrete implementations from both the
interface and the window implementations.

<P><B><I>Cedric: another one, more suited IMHO, is delegation, but this
was not mentioned.</I></B>

<P><B><I>Then again, I found that Bjarne didn't go far enough in his point.
My perception is that this is another attempt to explain how STL is such
a fine library. Here, Bjarne tried to show that blindly deriving can be
nasty, and that this shouldn't be done without careful consideration. The
STL shows how it is possible to build a sound hierarchy while avoiding
almost entirely derivation, and promoting aggregation and combining orthogonal
functionalities. BTW, I love the STL, in case you hadn't noticed.</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
THE STANDARD</H3>
Bjarne concluded by summing up the standardization process as of today
(March 12, 1998). He says he is very pleased with the current state of
affairs :
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
the standard doesn't contain gratuitous features</LI>

<LI>
there are no missing features</LI>

<LI>
there are no gross mistakes</LI>

<LI>
it comes with very nice libraries (STL, Math)</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<H3>
CONCLUSION</H3>
Bjarne can't understand how people can spend days trying to determine whether
putting the keyword "const" at this place is appropriate or not. The programmers
should focus on design, programming techniques and abstraction. They should
treat as secondary the language technical details and resist the temptation
to imitate foreign styles when writing in C++. "Use the type system, don't
fight it".

<P>Regarding the STL, Bjarne reminded that however well-designed it is,
it remains a low-level library, which purposefully exposes low-level details
(like allocators) . It should be seen as a foundation for higher-level
frameworks.

<P><B><I>Cedric: C++ is in good way, and should become even more enjoyable
to use in the forthcoming two years, while the standard slowly percolates
through available implementations. Compiler vendors are working real hard
to catch up with it, and the first fully ISO-C++ compilers should be expected
in the next few months (my guess is that VC++ will be the first one, while
Sun announced that their next major version wouldn't be out before at least
eighteen months).</I></B>
<H3>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H3>
Q: What do you thing about Java ?

<P><B><I>Cedric: augh....</I></B>

<P>A: If Java was just a programming language, nobody would have bothered
at all. It is however an extraordinary example of a company betting its
very existence on a single idea. Java is very uninteresting (the worst
language I have seen in years) and it's a shame Sun makes claims that cannot
possibly be delivered.

<P><B><I>Cedric: I am really saddened by his recent statements on Java.
Bjarne has always been a model in objectivity and reasoned opinions, but
I can't understand these emotional sentences. This is even more unforgiveable
that he could just stick to facts (like the hype) and he would gain immediate
approval of any crowd, however hostile to C++ they may be.</I></B>

<P><B><I>The worse is that he is usually much more balanced and neutral
during Committtee sessions. Why he chose to be so aggressive toward Java
in front of an open audience, I can't understand. Many people will most
likely consider this as bitterness coming from someone who sees his baby
somehow "threatened" by a newer and challenging contender.</I></B>

<P><B><I>I don't see things this way at all. I still believe Stroustrup
is definitely non-emotional on this issue, but is grieved to see that all
the pragmatic considerations that have always guided the evolution of C++
have been completely discarded (and even despised) by Java creators.</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Q: How are the C9X and C++ Committee cooperating ? Isn't this a oneway
process ?

<P><B><I>Cedric: a very insightful question, which had been discussed a
few days ago during the meeting</I></B>

<P>A: My impression is that C9X is driven by Fortran programmers trying
to write Fortran code in C, and who are not that interested in adding design
features (strong typing mostly).

<P><B><I>Cedric: This is a very hot topic. The feelings on this issue among
the C++ Committee are mixed, but some of them definitely have a few problems
with the C9X people. This comes as no surprise actually, that C9X is only
remotely interested in C++ while the opposite is really true. My feeling
is that the differences can't be worked out, and I think the forthcoming
versions of C and C++ will not be compatible. This has become less an issue
by now, since C++ has now gained wide acceptance, but it would definitely
have immediately grinded C++ to a halt if such a resolution had been taken
ten years ago.</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Q: Is anything missing in the standard ?

<P>A: No.

<P><B><I>Cedric: Of course, Stroustrup (just like everyone else) has minor
nits about the standard but to put the words in his mouth "I can't think
of a missing feature I'd like to see added at all costs, nor of a feature
I'd like to see removed".</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Q: What would you consider for future additions to the language ?

<P>A: I have been thinking for the past years about including concurrency
about the language, and the reason why it hasn't been done is that I haven't
been able to figure out a general-purpose and elegant solution that would
cover all the possible aspects of concurrency Concurrency can mean many
different things (process-level, database access, threads, etc...) and
so far, not a single approach has been identified that could "do it right".

<P><B><I>Cedric: Other considerations for future inclusion in the language
: garbage collection and embedded C++.</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
MY CONCLUSION</H3>
<B><I>A very enjoyable presentation, although it lacked some dynamism.
I suspect someone like Andrew Koenig or Steve Clamage would have made the
speech more living somehow. I hope that this brief introduction to the
STL and generic programming in general convinced some people in the audience
that C++ is definitely worth a try, and this is even more so since the
standard has now been accepted.</I></B>

<P><B><I>The next ISO C++ Commitee will be hosted by SGI in the Silicon
Valley. Then, it will probably be Dublin and then Hawaii.</I></B>
