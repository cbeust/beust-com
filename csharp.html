<h3>Language features</h3>

<ul>
    <li><em>Overriding must be explicit; it cannot happen
        inadvertently as in C++ or Java. <br>
        <br>
        </em>I am not fond of this feature, and it was turned
        down by the C++ Commitee years ago for good reasons.One
        of them being that if a developer writes a method that
        matches exactly that of a parent class, it's extremely
        unlikely that they do not want polymorphism to apply to
        it. Another (more minor) point is that it is certainly
        going to take me a while to get used to writing <br>
        <p><SPAN class="code"> <tt>public override string ToString() {...} </SPAN></tt> <br>
        </p>
        <p>(and don't even get me started on string with a
        lowercase s and ToString with a capital T). Oh and
        override must be used in conjunction with virtual in the
        derived classes... ugly IMO. <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Placeholders for string formatting : <br>
        <p><SPAN class="code"> <tt>Console.WriteLine(&quot;Values : {0}, {1}&quot;,
        v1, v2); </SPAN></tt> </p>
        <p>This feature will make definitely make internationalization of
C# programs easy.  <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>No keywords extends or implements : <br>
        <blockquote>
            <p><SPAN class="code"> <tt>public class A : B, IFoo { <br>
            <br>
            }<br>
</SPAN>            </tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The keywords extends and implements have always
        bothered me. On one side, recommended style is not to put
        semantics into naming (Sun has been bashing Microsoft's
        Hungarian notation for that very reason) and on the other side,
        you need to remember which types are interfaces, which
        you must implement, and which others are classes, which
        you must extend. We don't really need those keywords :
        just impose the first type to be the base class and the
        other types, the interfaces (I assume that's what C# does).</p>
        <p>Note that C#, just like Java, has single inheritance
        of implementation and multiple inheritance of interfaces.
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>All types are objects (e.g. int and System.Int32 are
        equivalent, although the use of the former is recommended.)
        Although Smalltalk has cast a bad shadow on this practice,
        I have always thought the principle was sound and I was
        hoping that we would reach a point where performance
        imperatives would no longer make it mandatory to have
        native types. We'll see if C# finally made that happen.
        Regardless, this inconsistency in the type system had
        made it hard for both C++ and Java in many ways : for C++,
        consider templates, which often have to be specialized
        for primitive types, and for Java, introspection and
        runtime discovery must often cater to both type systems
        and introduce restrictions on primitive types (containers
        cannot contain them, for example). <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Jagged arrays (arrays of arrays of irregular size)<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Microsoft is unfortunately (but not surprisingly)
        perpetuating its capitalization rules. Method names start
        with an uppercase letter while some types (not all) start
        with a lowercase : &quot;object&quot;, &quot;string&quot;
        but &quot;Main&quot;<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Reference parameters. The keyword &quot;ref&quot; allows
        the developer to specify that parameters can be passed by
        reference. There is a weird twist, though : it must be
        used in both the declaration and the use of the method.
        This makes it easy for somebody reading the code to be
        aware that the method might change the parameters that
        are given to it. More contestable is the (re)introduction
        of the &quot;out&quot; qualifier. I wish they had stuck
        with Ada's &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot; and &quot;inout&quot;.
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Variable length methods are finally back ! A new keyword
        &quot;params&quot; allows to declare a method with a
        variable number of parameters. Once a method is declared
        with a &quot;params&quot; parameter (which must always
        come last), it can be invoked in any way : <br>
        <blockquote>
            <p><tt>void foo(params int[] args) { ... } <br>
            <br>
            foo(1); <br>
            foo(2, 3); <br>
            foo(new int[] { 1, 2, 3}); <br>
            </tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>With this feature, it becomes possible to use a powerful C++ idiom : partial
        specialization. You can partially specialize the
        overloaded method for the most-frequent cases and leave
        the generic case to the 'params' signature. <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>New statements : foreach, checked/unchecked (for numeric precision, which seems to top at twenty-eight digits, a number I think might not be satisfactory for numericians) and lock (the
        C# synchronized). <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Properties are glorified fields : their declaration is
        made in two parts. The first one is the standard field
        declaration, and the second one defines accessors :<blockquote>
            <p><tt>public class Button {</tt></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><tt>private string caption;<br>
                public string Caption {<br>
                get { return caption; } set { caption = value;
                Repaint(); }</tt></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><tt>}</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><tt><br>
        </tt>This is a mix of Ada's &quot;quote&quot; operator
        and of Eiffel's field-methods (or C++'s overloading of
        the == operator). While it can make the code more
        readable, it also introduces side effects which Java
        developers can find disruptive. This is pretty much the
        classical debate about operator overloading, so no need
        to get into more details. <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Events and event handlers are part of C#. While this may
        look like a JavaBeans legacy, my guess is that it's been
        more driven by OLE and Visual Basic, which make heavy use
        of them. I don't think you will use much of this feature
        if you're not into COM programming (but then again, if
        you're not, why are you using C# ?). <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Speaking of operator overloading, it is alive and well,
        and very similar to its C++ counterpart. It even includes
        type conversion operators. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Types can exhibit array-like behaviors by becoming
        indexers (this is similar to C++' operator[]). <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>C# has destructors, and while they have the same syntax
        as C++ (~), they are more like Java finalizers, except
        that they are guaranteed to be called by the garbage
        collector. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Delegates are there, and they are similar to the ones you
        had in J++. I've always liked them, so I'm pretty happy.
        I've never liked the explosion of useless objects that
        Java forces upon you in order to create method-objects.
        Anything that can address this flaw is welcome, and
        delegates fit the bill very well. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Enums are back too, and they are type-safe. A very
        welcome addition that Java has been fighting with hoards
        of Integer constants scattered throughout hundreds of
        interfaces. It's time to end the technology madness. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Namespaces and assemblies are more Windows-oriented
        features that will make application packagers happy. They
        make it easy to create libraries or executables without
        going through the painful process of identifying the
        needed libraries that must appear on a two hundred
        character long command line. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>After a quick read, C#'s versioning looks ill-formed to
        me. They are trying to solve a problem which I believe
        rarely happens, and cluttering the language with another
        syntactical construct to address it is not going to help.
        Java's serialVersionUID is a crude but effective, and
        easy to explain, way to express the same constraint : the
        developer can force the compile to accept the new class
        as being compatible with its previous version if they so
        desire. Maybe there are deeper (probably DLL related)
        issues at stake here, so I'll have to revisit the subject
        later. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>XML support. A Welcome addition, unfortunately, the
        introduction is fairly sparse : <br>
        <br>
        <em>C# allows the XML data to be mapped directly into a
        struct data type instead of a class. This is a more
        efficient way to handle small amounts of data. </em><br>
        <br>
        I wish they were a little more detailed on this feature.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Libraries : of course, not a word on them in the language
        specification. Since C# is a Windows-oriented language,
        it's fairly easy to guess what libraries will be there :
        we can probably expect a mix of MFC and WFC, along with
        the COM packages that made J++ an ideal tool for COM
        programming.<br>
        <br>
        My secret hope is that the XML support mentioned above
        will be accompanied by a native DHTML library. Basically,
        I want to be able to write WFC code and have it display
        either native MFC windows or be suitable for rendering in
        a DOM browser.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>What's missing</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Threads. Although the keyword &quot;lock&quot; makes me
        believe there is thread support, the rest of it will
        probably be implemented in the libraries.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Security. No sandbox, nothing. Cool.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>Templates. No matter how much I love them in C++, I
        believe they don't belong in a language such as C# or
        Java, so I won't miss them.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>An interesting language, although not as simple as I expected
it to be. It's most likely going to be a resounding success as it
fills an empty spot in the Windows development suite. Code
written in C# will undoubtedly be more readable than in C++, but
there are still a lot of features that won't make it as easy as
it could have been (I expect a lof of abuse from operator
overloading). C# caters to both C++ and Visual Basic programmers
and I expect the curve won't be too steep for them.</p>

<p>As for Java programmers, well, it's pretty obvious that my
future Windows developments will be done in C#, and no matter how
close it is to Java, I just wish I didn't have to make space for
yet another language in my brain, which is already fairly
cluttered up.</p>
