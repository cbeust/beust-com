With the help of the Lensmaker, I crafted the Vortex Lens by which I could see the Codex where it originally rested. I created the Vortex Cube to focus the power of the Moonstones and draw the Vortex down to the world. Then I used the lens to form an image of the Codex upon the cube. The Vortex touched our plane, the image became solid and the Codex was brought down to be used properly by our race.
