  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><strong>Monday Keynote</strong></font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">John Gage is up to the plate again, and 
  he's speaking slower than ever.&nbsp; But he is still interesting and is actually 
  good at communicating things that would otherwise be boring.&nbsp; </font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">We were inflicted the now ritual &quot;whoever 
  was there 7 years ago at the first JavaOne, please stand up&quot; but one thing 
  blatantly missing was the bragging about the attendance.&nbsp; Two years ago, 
  20,000 people, last year 17,000 and this year, from unofficial sources, 
  12,000.&nbsp; Quite a steep decline.&nbsp; No wonder they would be quiet about it.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Shortly after the keynote started, the 
  moment I was dreading came up:&nbsp; Pat Sueltz came on stage.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">She has considerably improved over the 
  past year (see <a href="http://beust.com/cedric/javaone-2001.html">
  http://beust.com/cedric/javaone-2001.html</a>) but it still took her only 
  thirty seconds to blurt out a cocky statement:&nbsp; that she was there since the 
  very beginning.&nbsp; That might be true, but she conveniently omits to mention 
  that she only joined Sun two years ago.&nbsp; I'm not sure why she brushes me the 
  wrong way like this, but I believe it's due in great part to the 
  condescendence in her tone.&nbsp; Even when she calls up people on stage (&quot;Please 
  welcome my chief technology officer&quot;).&nbsp; Well, at least this year, she was 
  dressed reasonably well.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The highlight of the keynote was Rich 
  Green, in charge of the Java and XML platform.&nbsp; He opened saying that the 
  previous week, he was testifying in the Microsoft case, and at this point, I 
  was expecting the inevitable obligatory Microsoft mudsling.&nbsp; Well, it didn't 
  happen.&nbsp; Rich used this introduction to make general and valid comments about 
  the importance of open processes and API's.&nbsp; All the more credit to him for 
  not taking the bait.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">His speech was focused on the growth of 
  Java, of course, and the ever-increasing share of wireless devices running 
  Java out there.&nbsp; I'm still not quite sure about the reality of the numbers, 
  though, because what I hear at JavaOne certainly doesn't match my perception 
  of the world, but I might be wrong (and probably biased since I'm still having 
  a hard time seeing Java perform any decent job in tiny devices).</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Gosling followed him, proceeded with the 
  time-honored tradition of t-shirt slinging and then, skipped his traditional 
  speech (usually not that interesting, IMO) to get directly to two demos.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The first one was for a CAD program which 
  uses the Java3D and Java2D API's to render complex scenes in very acceptable 
  times (caveat:&nbsp; some parts of it are written in C++ and accessed through JNI).&nbsp; 
  Nice piece of work.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Then NetBeans took the stage with a 
  plug-in for J2EE development (Gosling seems to be involved with NetBeans 
  now).&nbsp; The demo was hard to follow because of the tiny fonts (and probably due 
  to the fact that they are using Netscape...) and frankly, I think NetBeans 
  doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Rational Rose, Together (admittedly way 
  too expensive) or even JBuilder.&nbsp; And mark my words, but I predict that 
  Eclipse is going to cast a huge shadow on all these products in a very near 
  future.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">In the evening, I went to the JavaWorld 
  award party, where I met some familiar faces (including Marc Fleury, who was 
  in competition with us and WebSphere for the best application server.&nbsp; JBoss 
  won, by the way).&nbsp; The JavaWorld award parties used to be big and animated, 
  this one was a dud.&nbsp; Very few people, some shy applauses and hardly anyone 
  paying attention to the addressing keynote, nor the comments from the 
  participants.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">After that, we headed for the Borland 
  party next door, which was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Not as good as eWorld in San Diego, 
  but darn good anyway.&nbsp; One piece of advice:&nbsp; don't trust their coat check.&nbsp; 
  They lost my bag there.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><strong>Tuesday Keynote</strong></font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">McNealy came on stage and he managed to do 
  a very decent job at keeping everyone interested while keeping the Microsoft 
  quips to a minimum.&nbsp; He emphasized the growth of Java and the importance of 
  open standards (and before you point it out, I'm not the one repeating things, 
  Sun is) and called the current conference &quot;JavaWon&quot;.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I'm usually not fond of Scott's speeches 
  but I was pleasantly surprised about this one.&nbsp; It looks like the high school 
  recess is finally over and we can get down to business.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I know that Larry Ellison tried hard to 
  get a keynote this year.&nbsp; I don't know if he really succeeded, but I was very 
  puzzled to see somebody else come on stage (Thomas Kurian, Senior vice 
  president of the Oracle Server Technologies Division).</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The sad thing for him is that as soon as 
  Scott was finished, half of the attendance left, leaving a nervous Kurian 
  enumerating figures such as &quot;8000 people bought Oracle 9 and it's the fastest 
  growing application server in the market&quot; (just like Linux which went up from 
  1% market share to 2%, a 100% increase.&nbsp; Woohoo).&nbsp; The demonstration of 
  JDeveloper that followed was very unimpressive.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">High performance JFC applications</font></b><p>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This presentation was made by three 
  engineers from the Swing team, and it was a bit disappointing.&nbsp; Each of 
  them addressed a different domain:&nbsp; high-level Swing, performance in 
  repaint and hardware acceleration.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The first part mentioned some obvious 
  tricks such as writing your own custom model whenever it's appropriate, and 
  also gave some overview of the new API's introduced in the JDK 1.4.&nbsp; The 
  following two parts were very low-level and probably only of relevance to 
  people doing imaging.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">One thing worth noting is that JDK 1.4 
  introduces the EventHandler as a way to create listeners.&nbsp; This class 
  belongs to the dynamic proxy package but it's being reused in this context in 
  order to avoid the proliferation of anonymous listener classes that simply 
  &quot;bounce back&quot; control to the callers.&nbsp; I'm happy that Sun finally 
  acknowledged this problem but...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Does the concept remind you of 
  something?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Delegates.&nbsp; One of the two reasons why Sun 
  sued Microsoft in the first place:&nbsp; because Microsoft had introduced this 
  concept in their own virtual machine and it was not Java.&nbsp; At least they 
  finally acknowledged the soundness of it (I've been asking for them ever since 
  I started using VJ++).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">My impression is that most JFC users 
  are more into high-level interfaces than low-level 2D and 3D graphics, and I 
  was hoping to get more insight about performances at this level, but I came 
  back empty-handed.</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">EJB 2.0:&nbsp; 20 things you've 
  never seen</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Tyler was giving this presentation, 
  which attracted a very compact crowd (people were sitting in the aisles).&nbsp; 
  He proceeded in dispelling all the myths that have plagued EJB because of the 
  deficiencies in the 1.1 specification and then emphasized how an improvement 
  EJB 2.0 was, even over solutions like Stateless Session Beans + JDBC.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The crowd was riveted.&nbsp; I was 
  checking regularly around me, and they were busily scribbling notes and 
  following every word Tyler was saying.&nbsp; The funny anecdotes that he 
  dispensed here and there definitely contributed to make people relate to the 
  problems he was addressing.&nbsp; There were a lot of questions after the 
  presentation and he was still being harassed on his way back to the booth :-)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I have no doubt that all the attendees 
  to this session will go back to their company and try to buy everyone around 
  them into EJB 2.0.</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">JDO with Entity and Session Beans&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Craig Russell, the JDO spec lead 
  (although, not exactly any more) gave this presentation.&nbsp; Before I dig 
  into it, some background about the JDO story.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The JDO effort started in a typical Sun 
  way:&nbsp; a skunk work by a little group which, after a little while, 
  received enough visibility within Sun to become a full project.&nbsp; By the 
  time Sun realized its mistake, it was too late:&nbsp; JDO was competing 
  against EJB and the customers became more confused than ever.&nbsp; Sun never 
  explained in a convincing manner what their position was, except maybe by 
  being clear on the fact that as of today, there was no plan to include JDO in 
  J2EE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Time went by, and when it became 
  obvious that JDO was nowhere near replacing EJB, Russell changed his angle, in 
  a purely &quot;if you can't beat them, join them&quot; fashion.&nbsp; The message he has 
  been pushing these past months was &quot;JDO can be an alternative to persist 
  Entity beans&quot;.&nbsp; Hence this talk, and my great interest in it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Craig opened by enumerating all the 
  ways that Java objects can be persisted: File I/O, Serialization (I'm unclear 
  on the difference between these two), JDBC, CMP and JDO.&nbsp; The way he sees 
  JDO plugging itself in EJB's is by the use of BMP.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">While it is indeed the only approach 
  that makes sense, it makes me very puzzled.&nbsp; As CMP is finally getting 
  the recognition it deserves with EJB 2.0 and when we are finally about to see 
  J2EE users embrace it in full, Sun makes the same mistake again by pushing a 
  technology that will do nothing else than confusing its customers more, and 
  for a result that is far from being overwhelmingly better.&nbsp; But let's 
  leave the controversy for now and focus on the technical side.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Then again, the presentation fell very 
  short.&nbsp; First of all, advocating BMP to push a persistence mechanism is a 
  huge step backward to me, and I don't think I need to explain why it is a bad 
  idea to suggest to customers that they should implement their own transaction 
  marks, handling rollbacks, etc...&nbsp; But most of all, when showing 
  different pieces of code illustrating the different approach (CMP vs BMP/JDO), 
  the difference wasn't very striking to me.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Basically, with CMP, you look up the 
  JNDI name of the home, perform a findByPrimaryKey() and then act on the 
  result.&nbsp; With JDO, you look up the JDO persistence manager, retrieve the 
  object by its key and then do something with it.&nbsp; Admittedly, the implied 
  deployment descriptors are overlooked, but this is more a matter of having 
  good tools (e.g. WebLogic Builder ;-)) rather than a deficiency in the 
  technology.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">There are two interesting things to say 
  about JDO, though, but the funny thing is that Craig is pushing the one that 
  seems the least useful to me:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">JDO supports inheritance of objects 
    (this is what Craig emphasizes)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">JDO's query language is Java (this 
    part is hardly mentioned)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">After doing SQL and EJB QL for a while, 
  I would certainly feel relieved to write my queries in Java.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The biggest disappointment came when 
  the session ended when I expected that we were finally getting to the 
  interesting part.&nbsp; I can't really understand why Craig thinks that EJB 
  users will be thrilled to use BMP and JDO, but maybe I'm just missing 
  something.</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">WebWorks</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Later that day, I met with Rickard at a 
  pub, who was hanging out with some of the WebWorks developers.&nbsp; WebWorks 
  is a competitor to Struts, and while I think it will be an uphill battle for 
  Rickard and his team, there is certainly room for competition in this area.&nbsp; 
  I didn't have a lot of time to drink more beers with them because I had to 
  head out to the session that I definitely was looking the more forward to...</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Eclipse</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The OTI team had reserved the Thirsty 
  Bear on Wednesday night to showcase Eclipse and get feedback from users.&nbsp; 
  For those of you who don't know Eclipse, in a nutshell:&nbsp; it's a pluggable 
  IDE developed by OTI (acquired by IBM) and which is the foundation for WSAD (WebSphere 
  Application Developer).&nbsp; Eclipse features an extremely slick UI (not 
  Swing) and a very powerful and well-documented plug-in back-end (a lot of 
  external plug-ins already exist, with a lot more to come).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Simply put, I was blown away the first 
  time I tried Eclipse six months ago, and things are only getting better.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Erich Gamma, of Design Patterns fame 
  (you should know him, or you shouldn't even be allowed to read this) started 
  by demoing the basic features of Eclipse.&nbsp; In short:&nbsp; intelligent 
  editing, debugging (including hot replacing of code), refactoring (very neat, 
  especially if you like Beck's books and the principles of XP in general, or 
  just if you have ever wanted to rename a method across a whole project or 
  &quot;pull up&quot; methods in a hierarchy of classes), smart diff and merging of files, 
  support of version control systems, history snapshots, etc...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">It's hard to communicate why Eclipse 
  feels so good to use, because a lot is due to little details that manifest 
  themselves to you as you use the tool.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">After Erich, another OTI member stepped 
  up and asked what was the platform that users wanted most for their next 
  porting effort.&nbsp; Four hands came up and clamored &quot;MacOS&quot; (no surprise 
  here, it's pretty much the only platform not on the SWT porting list yet).&nbsp; 
  Well, surprise, OTI unveiled a Mac laptop and showed Eclipse running on it.&nbsp; 
  It's probably still in beta, but Eclipse will definitely appear on MacOS X in 
  a very near future.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Then the session broke down to 
  questions and answers, most of which were hard to follow because the upper 
  floor of the Thirsty Bear is very noisy, but I ended up talking with John 
  Wiegand, who is the lead architect for the IDE, and exposed to him some of the 
  problems I encountered with Eclipse (mostly due to the way they manage their 
  filesystem).&nbsp; Not only did John pay careful attention to the problem I 
  was bringing up, and he immediately understood its importance, but he also 
  remembered my name from seeing my postings on the newsgroup.&nbsp; The 
  newsgroups receive something like two hundred messages every day and I've only 
  posted there a few times...&nbsp; I think this explains a lot why the support 
  provided by the OTI team there is top-notch.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Keep a close eye on Eclipse, it's going 
  to change the way we write code.</font></p>
