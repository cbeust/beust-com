General remarks</H2>
XML is taking off. Of course, all the participants
in this conference have an interest in XML, but it was pretty clear from
all the talks that everyone agrees on its soundness. Everything
is not so rosy, though.

<P>One of XML's main strengths is that it's extremely bare-bone and simple.
This is also its drawback : in order to be really useful, XML must be complemented
with a host of additional standards that take on where XML leaves off.
Thus the necessity of the DOM, RDF, CSS, XSL, XPointer,
XLink, and ECMAScript. One of the dangers is that XML might collapse under
the weight of all these additional standards, which are far from being
simple (check out CSS2 or Schemas).

<P>XSL and Java are definitely hot. A good property of XSL is that it can
be used both on the server (on the short term, to output HTML) and on the
client, on next-generation browsers (IE5, Gecko). XSL is powerful but it
also has blatant lacks. It's hard to predict where is it headed now since
the standard is still under way, but let's hope that it will address all
the issues. Meanwhile, vendors are using subsets of the norm and mixing
those with proprietary solutions (see the talk on the "Coolest XML client-side
application").

<SPAN class="presentation-title">Tutorial : RDF and Metadata, Ora Lassita
(Nokia), Bob Schloss (IBM Watson)&nbsp;</SPAN></H2>
<SPAN class="remark">[Note : <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/RDF">RDF</A> is
the Resource Description Framework, a standard put forth by the W3C to express
meta-data on any kind of documents. See their <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">Web
site</A> for more details]&nbsp;</SPAN>
<H3>
What is wrong with the Web ?</H3>
The Web is suited for machine to machine interaction but its content is
formatted for human interpretation. It is machine readable but not machine
understandable, and therefore, hard to automate. Some metadata is needed,
data with structure and semantics.

<P>A Web Metadata is a machine understandable description of Web resources
(and a Web resource is an object addressable by a URI).

<P>There are a lot of possible applications to Metadata :
<UL>
<LI>
cataloging</LI>

<LI>
resource discovery</LI>

<LI>
e-commerce</LI>

<LI>
intelligent software agent</LI>

<LI>
digital signature</LI>

<LI>
content rating</LI>

<LI>
IP rights</LI>

<LI>
privacy and policies</LI>

<LI>
personalization and customization</LI>
</UL>
<SPAN class="remark">[First question to speakers : is Metadata going to
replace DTD's ? Answer : the W3C Schema Working group is working on that.
It's true that there are a lot of commonalities]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="remark">[Question : what happens when we have 32 different
"standard" DTD's ? Answer : There is an ongoing work to register DTD's
in a central repository. And even though DTD's may differ superficially,
a lot of doctypes are actually compatible. Use XSL to make up for the differences.
]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>In brief, RDF is machine understandable, I18N compatible, domain neutral
and application neutral. It provides interoperability with no or little
ambiguity. It came from META and PICS.

<P>As of today, there are three Propositions&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[i.e.,
not Recommendations (in W3C terminology).]&nbsp;</SPAN>: PICS-NG (W3C),
MCF (Netscape) and XML Data (Microsoft).
<H3>
Model and Syntax</H3>
RDF in a few words :
<UL>
<LI>
domain neutral, application neutral, I18N</LI>

<LI>
viewed as a DAG on an object oriented tree</LI>

<LI>
uses XML</LI>

<LI>
machine understandable</LI>
</UL>
<SPAN class="remark">[At this point, I can't resist and ask a question
that has been nagging me for a while. The speakers keep mentioning this
"machine understandable" thing but XML, as a text format, is much more
human-readable than machine readable. Why isn't RDF using a binary format,
much more appropriate for machine interpretation ? Answer : the speaker
(Ora) agrees and actually, his first proposition to the W3C was not XML.
But he was turned down and XML was eventually chosen. It doesn't make much
sense in that respect, except maybe that XML is trendy].&nbsp;</SPAN>
<BR><SPAN class="remark">[I still find that there is a greater issue at
stake here. XML has very good properties but we can very much predict that
it will be abused. I have the feeling that RDF as XML is such an abuse.
This could be reasonably addressed by compression or tokenization, though,
but my point is that nobody is writing XML or HTML documents by hand (except
for me, currently writing HTML in emacs ;-)) and that the "readability"
point for XML is not always relevant. ]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>As a conclusion to this debate, RDF is independant of XML. Other syntaxes
are possible.
<H3>
RDF Model</H3>
There are three different types :
<UL>
<LI>
Resource (anything that has a URI)</LI>

<LI>
Property (a relation or an attribute used in describing resources)</LI>

<LI>
Statement (resource + property + value)</LI>
</UL>
Values are not only strings : they can be arbitrarily complex tree structures
and can also be embedded or referenced (with links).&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[There
is no such thing as an RDF DTD : XML is not even sufficient for RDF, they
are using a lot of namespaces and sometimes, they go beyond what is actually
specified. ]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="remark">[One more reason in my eyes why XML is not an appropriate
format for RDF. Their simple examples, using merely two or three namespaces,
were already painful to read. And all that for simple annotations.&nbsp;</SPAN>
<H3>
Containers</H3>
Containers allow to group objects. There are three different types of containers
:
<UL>
<LI>
bag (unordered)</LI>

<LI>
seq (ordered)</LI>

<LI>
alt (represents alternatives. For example, it may be the titles of a book
in different languages</LI>
</UL>
It is possible to create collections based on URL patterns.&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[Actually,
the patterns are limited to prefixes].&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>Duplicates are allowed since there are no mechanisms to enforce uniqueness.

<P>Example of a container in pseudo-language :
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>{ "http://...", dc:Creator, x}</TT>
<BR><TT>{ x, rdf:_1, "Ora" }</TT>
<BR><TT>{ x, rdf:_2, "Ralph" }</TT>
<BR><TT>{ x, rdf:Type, rdf:seq }</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><SPAN class="remark">[I find this specification in pseudo-language much
easier to read than the actual XML source !]&nbsp;</SPAN>
<H3>
Referents</H3>
You can reference groups of URI's of different manners :
<UL>
<LI>
A URI : about=</LI>

<LI>
An implicit group of URI's : aboutEachPrefix=</LI>

<LI>
An explicit group of URI's : aboutEach=</LI>
</UL>
For example, it is possible to specify that all documents of a given site
(or sub-tree in the site) must receive a certain meta-data (like a copyright).

<P><SPAN class="remark">[Overall an enjoyable talk although the afternoon
was much more boring, going through a lot of different sources and explaining
them line by line. I have a few concerns, though :
<UL>
<LI>
Even though RDF is about meta-data, all the examples given by the speakers
were much more "data" than "meta-data" to me. Which leads me to the thought
that RDF and XML are treading on the same grounds and that maybe, one of
them will be absorbed by the other in a near future.<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
However interesting, RDF is still being used very marginally. Gecko makes
heavy use of it but it's all internal and not exposed for general use.</LI>

<SPAN class="presentation-title">Keynote : Jon Bosak&nbsp;</SPAN></H3>


<P>Jon Bosak opens the conference with his keynote. His goal is to get
over with "Boring Old Documents" (the current documents you can find on
the Web) and switch to the next step. It is vital to separate content and
structure and then format them (HTML mixes all that). Whatever may come
in the future, documents will live, they won't go away.

<P>The current trend is to move away from procedural and toward declarative
and object oriented documents (Poscript vs PDF). Printing will not disappear
either. Actually, formatting is a superset of printing. A printed document
allows very limited interaction whereas an online document will let you
do almost anything.

<P>Bosak then shows NetPost, a prototype used by Sun to illustrate the
benefits of XML. It is an online newspaper that can change its look completely
without changing the content. With only one click, the shown pages switch
from the the "NY Post" layout to the ESPN one. Advertisement will gain
more and more importance. Online documents allow to break new grounds in
that respect : you can customize your ad depending on the content of the
article (for example, if an article tells the story of a plane crash, it
would be a bad idea for a company like United Airlines to advertise on
that very page).

<P><SPAN class="remark">[I am puzzled : I am not sure an online newpaper
is a good illustration of the concept. People will never leave their paper
newspaper for an online one. He could have picked a much more telling example,
like one of a portal gathering summaries of major headlines.]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>However good XML is, its rendering is limited to HTML right now, and
it is trapped in Middleware. That's why Sun wants to jumpstart XSL.

<P><SPAN class="remark">[Bosak then announces that Sun is offering a $30,000
grant for whoever will be able to add XSL support in Gecko (the new open-sourced
Navigator) by the end of the year. The announcement comes as a complete
surprise and still makes us wonder. In my opinion, it just can't be done.
More on this below with the <A HREF="#trenches">CiRTECH presentation</A>.]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>Bosak concludes that "we are getting out of proprietary format, and
XML is making that possible".

<P><SPAN class="remark">[I agree, and as a matter of fact, Office 2000
will come out with full XML support for save files, thus making the binary
upward compatibility headaches of current Word and Excel documents history.
However, I am definitely not convinced that this is happening because of
Sun's sheer mental force. XML is just an obligatory step now, and Microsoft
is pushing it more than anybody else. However, this will most likely allow
us to see more and more non-Microsoft document viewers, and that is a good
thing.]&nbsp;</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<SPAN class="presentation-title">Keynote : New Web standards&nbsp;</SPAN></H2>


<P>The next keynote is a panel of people taking parts in the various W3C
working groups. Five of them talked about the various activities they are
in charge of :
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-xlink-19980303">XLink</A> :
generalizes the notion of hyperlinks for XML&nbsp;<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
Schema : defines the structure, content and semantices of XML documents&nbsp;<BR>
<SPAN class="remark">[Schemas are on a collision course with DTD's. I am
not sure which one will win, although I would vote for Schemas. DTD's are
being pushed by SGML hard core gurus but some of their concerns are not
relevant to the current problem, and they are being way too religious about
it, trying to push features that don't make sense and dismissing any new
addition as useless.]&nbsp;</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
Fragments : Formalizes how it is possible to work with XML document fragments&nbsp;<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL">XSL</A> : The style sheet language
for XML.&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[This is undoubtedly the area where
most of the things will happen in a near future. Right now, XSL is the
only way to bridge XML and HTML, and in the future, it will move toward
the client and will allow things that we can barely envision right now.]&nbsp;</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/DOM">DOM</A> : the Document Object Model, which
is at the core of the whole new Web. Just ask Arnaud for the details, he

</UL>

<H2>
<SPAN class="presentation-title">SVG : Scalable Vector Graphics&nbsp;</SPAN></H2>


<P>This talk was made bu Jon Ferraiolo, who works for Adobe. Adobe is one
of the main proponents (and main implementor) for this spec. The idea is
to be able to specify 2D vectorial graphics in XML. Graphic is a very important
piece of document presentation and it is blatantly absent of current Web
standards. SVG addresses this need.

<P>SVG is a joint work by Microsoft, AutoDesk, HP, Macromedia, Adobe and
Visio. It must be
<UL>
<LI>
automatically editable</LI>

<LI>
readable by humans</LI>

<LI>
easy to generate by server-side technology (CGI, etc...)</LI>
</UL>
SVG offers a very rich feature set. It intends to replace totally GIF,
JPG and other PNG as an image format. It allows full resolution printing,
progressive rendering&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[This means that its content
will be displayed incrementally, so as not to leave the user with a blank
page while it is loading. It's a good thing that they're aware of the importance
of such a feature].&nbsp;</SPAN>Another crucial point : texts embedded
in the graphics must appear in textual form in the source, so that they
can be accurately archived by search engines.&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[Another
fine idea]&nbsp;</SPAN>Finally, it must supply interactivity and animation.

<P>SVG is made of three distinct items :
<UL>
<LI>
Shapes</LI>

<LI>
Texts</LI>

<LI>
Images</LI>
</UL>
It features gradients, patterns, text paths and alpha masks&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[Alpha
blending is a feature that makes a lot of promises for graphically appealing
documents].&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>Jon then proceed to do a demo. Pretty simple : the city of SF is represented,
then zoomed, showing coffee places. It also illustrates curved text (textpath)
with appropriate mouseOver() events.&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[I was unimpressed
by the demo]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>The main benefits of SVG is : faster downloads, less round trips to
the server, searchable graphics and scalable and zoomable graphical elements.

<P><SPAN class="remark">
[A good talk overall but Ferraiolo lacks a lot
of "bigger picture" vision. He didn't mention any drawback to SVG, not
even the most obvious one : scalable graphics imply much bigger documents
for possibly unused data. This is where the current map Web sites shine : they
only show you the map you want and will cause a round trip at each zoom,
but it's very much acceptable even with a slow connection.

<P>There is definitely a need for 2D graphics on the Web, but I am not
so sure it has to be vectorial. We have a few ideas on that one, but it's
still confidential ;-)]&nbsp;</SPAN>
</SPAN>
<P>

<SPAN class="presentation-title">
<H2>
XJ2 : Java based XML and XSL technology
</H2>
</SPAN>

<P>XJ2 is a Java XML parser (tests both well-formedness and validity).
It is SAX compliant and implements XML Namespaces. It implements the first
half of XSL's norm (Transformation) and is being realized in collaboration
with DataChannel. It supports both DTD's and DCD's, including strong data
typing.

<P>Available transformations as of today :
<UL>
<LI>
XML -> HTML (3.2, 4.0, CSS)</LI>

<LI>
XML -> XML</LI>

<LI>
XML -> anything</LI>
</UL>
<SPAN class="remark">[not sure what this last one means]&nbsp;</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class="remark">[The
talk was fine until then. XJ2 definitely looked like something worth checking
out. However, the speaker started contradicting himself by claiming support
for a wide range of heterogeneous browsers but then admitting that they
only work on the latest IE. Pressed to answer about additional features,
the speaker would consistently answer "if it is implemented in IE5, we
will do it".

<P>It more and more looked to me like they must have some special contract
with Microsoft but still, have no idea of what lies ahead. I am definitely
convinced that they are piggybacking MSIE5 but I completely fail to see
what their goal is or the point in their work. Oh well.]&nbsp;</SPAN>

Datacraft : databases on the Web&
</H2>
</SPAN>

<P>This tool comes from IBM Research. In order to achieve their e-commerce
strategies, IBM have to deal with major database issues. One of the challenge
is to map databases (often queried through XML or OO requests) to Web languages
(XML and HTML). Creating such mappings is not easy and Datacraft aims
at allowing developers to make this connection with a visual tool that
will take care of all the gritty details for them.

<P>Datacraft is an application development tool that allows to graphically
<UL>
<LI>
browse database schemas</LI>

<LI>
browse schema views</LI>

<LI>
build queries and query results</LI>
</UL>
Datacraft liberates application builders from database details. A database
schema is exported as both XML and RDF. The schema is then graphically
converted into a query.

<P>XML and RDF are used to describe database schemas and construct the
query graph. Datacraft uses Resource Attachments (RA) to specify connections.
The application runs as a Swing applet and therefore, needs a Swing-compatible
browser (not very common).

<P>
<SPAN class="remark">
The approach is definitely interesting but I suspect
the speaker to have left aside all the important stuff. The core of this
tool is in RA's, which specify how an XML/RDF request is mapped into a
database query and reciprocally. Since this specification has to be generic,
I suspect that writing RA's must be extremely tedious. It's probably okay
to use Datacraft when the appropriate RA exists, but it's most likely a
daunting task to write one.

I also regretted that he wasn't more explicit about how they use RDF,
since it is a format that can be easily abused and is definitely not easy
to write either.

<P><SPAN class="presentation-title">The Coolest Client-side XML application&nbsp;</SPAN>
</H2>

<P>Tony Stewart, from Rivcom, a small (~10 employees) company, gave this
talk. He spent about ten minutes raving about what they did and explaining
that he wouldn't have the time to explain it all within 45 minutes.

<P><SPAN class="remark">[I was already hating the talk before it even started.
Although this guy definitely has charisma and knows how to capture an audience,
his neverending rave without showing anything was very annoying.]&nbsp;</SPAN>Rivcom
has had to write a prototype of a Web application that they would show
to VC's in order to raise fundings. They were understaffed and faced impossible
deadlines&nbsp;<SPAN class="remark">[bla bla bla, yeah, right, Rambo]&nbsp;</SPAN>but
they took on the contract. They needed a shared XML database and had to be
able to update data in real time, both for the developer of the site,
but for the customer. Stewart then starts a first demo.

<P><SPAN class="remark">[The demo consisted in store listings that are
being updated in real time. The GUI and styles are also updated on all
open pages in real time. Now the guy has my attention. What he is showing
can definitely not be done with HTTP. My first guess is an underlying socket
with a file protocol. This will turn out to be WinINet and ftp later in
the talk.]&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>They use a proprietary language for both styles and behaviors (their
project started two years ago, CSS did not exist then and Javascript was
barely a blip on the radar). The whole demo fits in 13 XML files and uses
some additional Javascript with empty DIV statements.

<P>Rivcom was in charge of the browser side functionalities. The work was divided
in four tasks, four people and they used Frontpage and CSS to lay out the
basic look. Then came some C++ programming (ActiveX) and scripting. The
server side occupied three people.

<P>The main guidelines they followed to build this prototype are :
<UL>
<LI>
Be pragmatic, use long file names. The developer must be able to understand
what is going out by consulting the generated source.</LI>

<LI>
Ignore multi user issues (it's a prototype, it has to work and be completed
quickly)</LI>

<LI>
Make use of as many existing Web technologies as possible</LI>

<LI>
Expect to generate "real" CSS in the future</LI>

<LI>
Use ftp to upload and then issue a HTTP GET request to notify the server
that it has to reload some files off the database.</LI>
</UL>
<SPAN class="remark">[Now that last one is neat. Notice that it's a GET
request but what is really returned is just a true/false value, to indicate
whether the files could be successfully retrieved or not.]
</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN class="remark">
[I wasn't very optimistic at the beginning of this talk but it turned
out to be really interesting. Of course, certainly not as earth-shattering as the speaker
had announced, but one should never set the bar for oneself too high. As
goes a popular golf saying : "Never start a swing with something as predictible
as 'watch this'".
</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class="remark">
Anyway. While their solution relies on a great part on proprietary standards,
these guys are definitely on to something. Their exploration of this area
shows where the needs are and their prototype is a glimpse of future Web
applications. This is as much hacky as Web programming can be. I like that.

very well on the "Wow" scale. He showed XML mixing with CSS, dynamically
modifying the graphical layout of several pages. We also saw some XSL (not
much though) but that was about all.&nbsp;</SPAN>

<P>Vidur is the technical lead for the implementatino of the DOM and XML
for the Mozilla open-source project. I thought that Gecko would pale in
comparison to IE5 (previous talk) but actually, the demo was okay. However,
Gecko is clearly way behind IE5 in a lot of areas (except maybe for CSS)
