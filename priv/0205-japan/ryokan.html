<p>Ryokans are traditional Japanese hotels.&nbsp; You are greeted by nakai-san 
(maids dressed in a kimono, although the right name is &quot;wafuku&quot;) in the lobby as 
you remove your shoes.&nbsp; Then one of them is assigned to your service and 
she will be the one serving you dinner and breakfast, making the room, preparing 
the futon, etc...&nbsp; During your stay in the room, you will typically be 
wearing a yukata (a light kimono), much more comfortable than any clothes you 
might have in your bags.</p>
<p>Ryokans are an amazing experience for a gaijin, but I strongly recommend 
going accompanied by a Japanese, who will interact with your hosts and also 
explain some of the rituals that you should obey if you don't want to shock 
anyone.</p>
<p>Here is the room, with a canal just a few blocks from downtown Kyoto.</p>

<p>Around 7pm, the nakai-san will set up the dinner in your room.&nbsp; The 
table is filled with very unusual food for Westerners, but pretty much 
everything I tasted was delicious.</p>

<p>Ryokans typically feature public bathrooms.&nbsp; Of course, you can always 
take your shower/bath in your room, but it's sometimes worth to check out the 
public baths, especially when they look like the one below (forgive the fuzzy 
picture, the room was quite steamy).&nbsp; If you are going to take a public 
bath, be aware that there are strict rules to observe if you don't want to upset 
your companions.&nbsp; For example, you must imperatively wash and rinse 
yourself with the showers <b>before</b> entering the bath.&nbsp; Don't leave one 
single drop of soap on your body before you step in the water, or you will get 
angry looks.</p>
