Spider webs, scary CDs, overhanging spiders, flying bats, skeletons hanging on a chain, smoke screens, etc... all contributed to make even climbing up the staircase a true adventure in itself.

<ul>
<li>Write some text on the front and the back. The front says... well, see for yourself on the picture below. On the back: "I'm a slayer. Ask me how". Some people did actually get it.
<li>Modify the mask to make it... let's say, happier.
</ul>
 Here is an early (and failed) attempt.</td>

There was no way I could modify the plastic mask I got, so I had to buy some white fabric and try to draw the face myself. Given how pathetic I am at drawing in general and how hard it was to find a model of the smiling Ghostface on the Internet, it comes as no surprise that I didn't really succeed. While the face itself looks okay on a flat surface:</td>
