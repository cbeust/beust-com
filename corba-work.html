I first became acquainted with CORBA during my PhD, which examines
the impact of distributed computing on traditional graphical
user interfaces. CORBA did not exist when I started my PhD so I was
using mainly raw TCP/IP and a Sun product called Tooltalk, also
referred to as a "software bus". This messaging API (as opposed to
function based API) allowed to connect several tools to a central "bus"
where they could interact and send events. The first version of CORBA
was released by the end of my PhD thesis and I started using ORB's by
then (mostly Post Modern Computing's Black Widow). 
<p>
Then I was hired by Ilog (http://www.ilog.com) where I worked on a
product called Ilog Broker. This software library also predates CORBA
and its goal is to allow seamless distribution of existing C++
code. You take an existing C++ header file, add some keywords (like
ASYNC, SYNC, OUT/IN for parameter passing, etc...) and Ilog Broker
will generate stubs to make your class remotely callable. When I
joined Ilog, Ilog Broker was using RPC as the underlying communication 
medium.
<p>

My job was to allow CORBA to be used instead of RPC. The tool would
have to generate IDL out of the annotated C++ header files and would
also create appropriate stub TIE files that had to concile both the
CORBA Dynamic Invokation Interface all the while being able to access
Ilog Broker's internal API. The CORBA framework had to allow the same advanced functionalities as the RPC one, including pass-by-value of objects and asynchronous constructors (which CORBA doesn't have and was critical to all our customers).
<p>

Ilog Broker is a both multi-thread safe (can safely be called from
multiple threads) and multi-thread hot (spawns several threads itself)
library. Therefore, I had to deal with these issues while inserting an 
ORB in the whole process. Our ORB of choice was Orbix. I started with
early versions of Orbix (1.2) and carried on until 2.3c. Initially,
the multi-thread support was very crude, not flexible and extremely
buggy. But this got better in Orbix 2.
<p>

I particularly enjoyed the flexibility offered by Orbix' threading
policies. It was important to be able to specify the granularity of
multi-threading : thread per object, thread per request or thread
per call. No ORB was as flexible then. I eventually came up with one
main thread receiving all incoming CORBA requests and dispatching them 
to the appropriate user objects. The said objects were blocking on
their own condition variable, waiting to be awakened by the main
thread. This architecture turned out to work quite well both on
Solaris and NT (NT requires some additional tweaking, though : it is
necessary to create an invisible window with its own thread and from
there, post wake-up messages on the main thread).
<p>

Orbix was suffering from two major drawbacks by then : the NT version
was very unreliable and Iona's support was extremely slow. This was
the main obstacle to delivering a product using this ORB and caused us 
to slip many times. Another problem, which all ORB's had, was that the 
POA did not exist then and therefore, all vendors had to supply their
own proprietary solutions to implement multi-threading, interface
repository, object activation, etc...
<p>

During this period, we considered switching away from Orbix. I was
asked to evaluate several ORB's. Therefore, I ran several benchmarks
on the current ORB's and analyzed their API's and support. In the end, 
the two candidates left were Orbix and Expersoft's PowerBroker.
<p>

PowerBroker was an extremely well designed ORB. It was very flexible,
supported CORBA 2 far better than any other ORB then and, more
importantly, was working fine on NT and even offered a CORBA-COM
(actually, only OLE and automation servers, but it was already much
more than most of its competitors) bridge that I tested with success
on many configurations : I was able to have NT/Solaris Java/C++ CORBA/OLE
processes interact with very little effort. We eventually ruled out
PowerBroker because of its insufficient (for our needs)
multi-threading support and also mostly because our customers were
requesting Orbix.
<p>

Some time later, I extended my benchmarks to include Java. Few Java
ORB's existed by then, but OrbixWeb was getting better and better. I
also included RMI in my benchmarks and the results were quite
amazing : RMI was about ten times slower than any other
ORB. Intrigued, I posted my benchmarks on the CORBA newsgroups and the 
Java mailing-lists. This is when I was contacted by Bob Orfali and Dan 
Harkey.
<p>

They were working on their latest CORBA book and they were
incorporating Java in the picture. They asked me if they could use my
benchmarks in their book. Later on, we kept exchanging data as Bob was busy
evangelizing people about CORBA and Java, and how RMI would be harmful 
to the cohesion of the CORBA movement, which was perceived as the only 
opponent to Microsoft's COM. RMI had to drop its proprietary protocol
and run over IIOP or it would fail.
<p:

Bob, myself and another person, Jeff Nelson, voiced our concerns on
comp.object.corba but we were received with a clear hostility from the 
Java crowd. Most of them didn't see any need to have RMI over IIOP and 
actually, some were affirming that it was simply not possible (the
main obstacles were : distributed garbage collection and
pass-by-value). Jeff eventually wrote a short prototype showing how
this could be done and from then, the heated debate turned to more
technical grounds. Jeff's work convinced Chris Stone and JavaSoft
eventually agreed to implement RMI over IIOP (more on Jeff's work can
be found at http://www.distributedobjects.com/portfolio/rmicorba).
<p>

Since then, I have kept in touch with Bob, Jeri and Dan and eventually 
met them a few years ago. As an aside, I have recently joined Dan Harkey's
distributed computing program in San Jose State University.

I occasionally like to write articles or reviews (http://beust.com/cedric)
and I like to keep up to date with the latest technologies, including
competings ones (ATL and COM mostly).
