<h1>A Rubik's cube solution that is easy to memorize</h1>

Cedric Beust (@cbeust), January 2003

<h2>Foreword</h2>

A couple of weeks ago at a party, I came in contact with a Rubik's cube.  It's not that I hadn't seen one in a long time (my very own faithful cube has been in my possession for over twenty years now), but for some reason, playing with that one revived in me the will to solve it again.

<p>

I used to be crazy about the Rubik's cube, back in high school something like twenty years ago.  We were running contests and I was able to solve it in a minute overall.  Not stellar, but decent.  There was one major difference, though:  back then, we didn't have the Internet.  I had gotten my solution in various magazines and I had added my own maneuvers in an attempt to speed up the process and beat my classmates.

<p>

When I looked it up on the Internet, I wasn't really surprised to find a wealth of information.  Much more than anything I had ever read on the topic.  There are all kinds of methodologies out there and a lot of people who took the time to put up Web pages have used various ways to reach their own solution, often assisted by a computer (see the links section below for details).

<p>

But at this point, I'm not really interested in speed cubing.  I just want a solution that's easy to memorize so I can revive the old feeling of beating the cube without reading a paper.  None of the solutions I read were really aimed at easy memorization, so I created this page.

<p>

You will find out that the first half of this solution is simple common sense and even though I took the trouble of enumerating each maneuver for the sake of completeness, you only need to memorize the maneuvers explained in the second part of this solution.  I am confident that the first part will stick with you since I remembered how to get that part myself even after twenty years of inactivity.

<p>

Therefore, I split this solution in two parts:  the easy one (in which you build the first two layers except for one edge) and the harder one, where you complete the cube using more complex maneuvers that you need to learn by heart.

<p>

As as side note, I focused on providing the maneuvers that you absolutely need to know in order to finish the cube (a total of eight maneuvers).  For every step of the second part, you can find on the Web similar maneuvers that will solve this stage when the cubies are in different locations.  I didn't include them in this solution so you are not overwhelmed or discouraged by the amount of what you need to learn, but once you are familiar with the maneuvers below to the point where you no longer need to think, I strongly recommend you follow the links I provide at the end of this page:  they will teach you more specialized maneuvers that will greatly speed up your cube solving.

<p>

As a final thought, it is just amazing how finger memory works.  It took me a couple of hours of practice to have this solution totally memorized in my fingers.  No more thinking in terms of "U" and "R prime", it just comes automatically.  Give it a try, practice these maneuvers over and over (even on an unmade cube), and you will learn it in no time.
Notation

<p>

I am using the popular notation that I found pretty much everywhere.  Each side is represented by its initial:  Front, Back, Left, Right, Up, Down.  A letter by itself (e.g. "R") means "turn this side clockwise".  A letter followed by a prime (e.g. "F'") means "turn this side counter-clockwise.  Finally, a letter followed by 2 (e.g. "L2", it should really be a square, not a 2) means "turn this side 180 degrees".  If you have any doubts, the applets will clear up any confusion you might feel.

<p>

One last note before we begin:  I shamelessly stole the slick cube applet from Lars, whose Web site you can find in the links section.  Be sure to check out his Rubik's page, there is a lot of information contained there.

<p>

Let's get started.

<h2>Phase one</h2>

This is the easy part where you could pretty much guess all these moves by yourself.  Before you can start, you need to pick a side and place the edges correctly so that the cube shows a cross.  I will skip this part because it's trivial, but if you disagree, please let me know and I will add a step-by-step description of how to get there.

<h3>
1a) Position three corners
</h3>

<p>

All four edges are in place, now we want to position three corners so that we end up with the first layer finished except for one corner.  Move a corner under its final position and apply one of the three following maneuvers:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<div id="1a-0" class="CedCube"
		    	cc-params="formula=fDF,startString=........w ......... ......... ......... .w.www.w. .........">
			</div>
		</td>
		<td>
			<div id="1a-1" class="CedCube"
		    	cc-params="formula=Rdr,startString=......... ......w.. ......... ......... .w.www.w. .........">
			</div>
		</td>
		<td>
			<div id="1a-2" class="CedCube"
		    	cc-params="formula=RddrDRdr,startString=......... ......... ......... ......... .w.www.w. ..w......">
			</div>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
