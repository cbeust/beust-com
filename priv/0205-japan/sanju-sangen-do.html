<p><a href="http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/tokuten/myoho/myoho2e.htm">Sanju-sangen-do</a>, 
also known as Rengeo-in, is the home of one thousand and one statues of the 
Buddhist deity Kannon.&nbsp; The temple was built in 1164 and then lost to a 
fire.&nbsp; It was reconstructed in 1266 and has remained unchanged since then.&nbsp; 
The hall is about 120 meters long.&nbsp; There are thirty-three spaces between 
the columns, hence the name of the temple (<i>sanju-san</i> means &quot;thirty-three&quot; 
and <i>gen</i> is the technical term to describe the space between the columns).</p>

<p>The picture below shows half of the temple.&nbsp; In front of these statues 
are twenty-eight more statues, guardians of Kannon.&nbsp; Many of these deities, 
whose mythic images are expressed in a vivid manner, have their origin in ancient 
India.&nbsp; Technically, these statues are made in an assembled construction 
method.&nbsp; Arms and heads were carved separately, then joined together, 
coated with lacquer and finished by coloring.</p>

<p>The hall is divided in two and in the middle sits this monumental 
representation of Kannon, whose official name is Juichimensenju-sengen Kanzeon.</p>
