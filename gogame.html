<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday, I finally got the opportunity to play a 
game of &quot;The Go game&quot; (</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.thegogame.com"><font color="#000000">http://www.thegogame.com</font></a></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">).</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a scavenger hunt where the clues are 
transmitted to you on cell phones supplied by the organizers, along with a 
digital camera (to prove that you solved the riddles) and a bunch of other props 
needed at various times during the game.&nbsp; Teams are typically made of six 
members (I only know one of them, I met the other four&nbsp;members that day).</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The pictures for our game are now available at

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The organizers do a very decent job at making the 
tests not too hard, but it's still not very easy to reach 100%, especially since 
some of them, called &quot;judgeable&quot;, will be graded by your peers at the end of the 
day.&nbsp; Needless to say that the people you play with contribute greatly to making 
this day enjoyable, but based on what I see, everybody who bothers signing up 
and paying the $25 (a bargain for a whole day of entertainment) usually have the 
required mindset to make this day a memorable one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to disclose too much of the riddles, 
even though the organizers go to great lengths to renew them at each game so 
that players can return and still have fun, so I will just list some highlights:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to run ourselves ragged all over North 
  Beach.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We successfully avoided Carrot-Top, who was 
  running around after us with a loaded can of silly-string.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We performed the can-can in front of Caffe 
  Puccini, much to the chagrin of innocent passers-by.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We ridiculed strangers.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We defiled public spaces.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost a contested fish race and won a 
  contested game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We turned sullen singles into a comatose couple 
  without even marrying them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We contributed to the cultural understanding 
  gap between the old folks of Chinatown and white SF yuppies.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We wore trash we pulled out from underneath 
  parked cars and committed minor property crimes against other parked cars.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We embarrassed an innocent driver who had the 
  misfortune to be parked near Washington Square by asking him if it was okay to 
  &quot;get frisky in the backseat&quot;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We made fun of an unwilling participant because 
  he was wearing a purple t-shirt</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We shot a masterpiece reenactment of Humpty-Dumpty 
  transposed during the feminist era</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We defaced public monuments while making fun of 
  Muni (a low blow, but other teams did worse)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We aced complex mathematic riddles (all two of 
  them, and they involved numbers that had more than two digits in them)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">We choreographed &quot;Cirque de Mugging&quot; in front 
  of City of Lights while we synchronized ballet moves with our lead actor, 
  Elliot sporting pantyhose on his head and the peer judging when we got to see 
  the immense, comic creativity of other teams.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the riddles involved making up a bumper 
sticker that would &quot;make the traffic stop&quot;.&nbsp; Here are the best ones:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Dick Cheney is hiding in my trunk&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Enron gave me $1 million. Ask me how&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Free <strike>Nelson Mandela<br>
  </strike>&nbsp;Free <strike>John Walker Lindh<br>
  </strike>&nbsp;Free PORN!&quot;</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks to my team for being so fun and also for 
contributing to this short report...</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Elliot, Wariya, Leslie, Gabriella and Melissa:&nbsp; 
you all kick major butt.&nbsp; Go Crouching Tigers!</font></p>
