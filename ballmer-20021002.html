Subject: Connecting with Customers<br>
<br>
<br>
Oct. 2, 2002<br>
<br>
I spend a lot of my time thinking about how Microsoft can do a better job of 
serving its customers. I'm convinced that we need to do more to establish and 
maintain broad connections with the millions of people who use our products and 
services around the world. We need to more thoroughly understand their needs, 
how they use technology, what they like about it, and what they don't. I'd like 
to share with you some of what we've recently begun to do and are planning for 
in the future to better connect with our customers.<br>
<br>
First I should give you some context on why I am sending you this email. This is 
one in an occasional series of mails that Bill Gates and I, and periodically 
other Microsoft executives, will be sending to people who are interested in 
hearing from us about technology and public-policy issues that we believe are 
important to computer users, our industry, and everyone who cares about the 
future of high technology. This is part of our commitment to ensuring that 
Microsoft is more open about communicating who we are, what we believe in, and 
what we are trying to achieve.<br>

SOFTWARE AND SNACK FOOD<br>
<br>
In my career, I've worked at only one other place besides Microsoft. I marketed 
brownie mix and blueberry muffin mix for one of the largest consumer products 
companies. I'm glad I decided to join Microsoft 22 years ago, when it was a 
little software startup, but I have great admiration for successful consumer 
businesses, and I believe Microsoft can learn from them. Behind the leading 
brands are companies that really know their customers. These firms devote a 
great deal of time and energy to gaining an intimate understanding of consumers, 
their reactions to every aspect of products, and how those products fit into 
their lives. Even so, not every new grocery or drug-store item succeeds. But by 
using the huge volume of data that feeds back from the daily purchase decisions 
of millions of consumers, marketers manage over time to figure out what 
consumers want in cake mix, soft drinks, shampoo, and so on. And these same 
products often go on satisfying consumers for decades.<br>
<br>
Satisfying customers is what it's all about with technology products, too. And 
customers expect the same high quality and reliability in computing devices and 
software as they do in consumer products. But meeting their expectations is much 
harder, and not just because information technology is more complex and 
interdependent. The challenge has more to do with the flexibility of technology 
and its continual, rapid advance. To take advantage of this and expand what 
people can do with hardware and software, computer products must constantly 
evolve. As a result, products are seldom around long enough in one form to be 
fully time-tested, let alone perfected. And customers continually come up with 
new uses for their technology, new combinations and configurations that further 
complicate technology companies' efforts to ensure a satisfying experience, free 
of hiccups and glitches.<br>
<br>
If technology products are to approach the satisfying consistency of consumer 
staples - and clearly they should - then we in the industry need a more detailed 
knowledge of customers' experiences with our products. We must do a better job 
of connecting with customers. For a company such as Microsoft, with many 
millions of customers around the world, the connections must be very broad. 
While we are working to deepen our relationships with enterprise and other 
business customers, we also need to make innumerable, daily connections with the 
very wide array of people who use our products - consumers, information workers, 
software developers and information technology professionals.<br>
<br>
In the past year, we specifically identified some near-term objectives on the 
road to further product improvements and greater customer satisfaction. Among 
them:<br>
<br>
- Obtain much more feedback from our customers about their experience;<br>
- Offer customers easier, more consistent ways to update their products;<br>
- Provide customers with more effective, readily available support and service.<br>
<br>
We have a long way to go, but we're excited about the results so far from some 
of our recent efforts. I'd like to share just one great example, and then I'll 
tell you how you can learn more about what we're doing along these lines.<br>
<br>
A NEW PIPELINE FOR CUSTOMER FEEDBACK<br>
<br>
Let's acknowledge a sad truth about software: any code of significant scope and 
power will have bugs in it. Even a relatively simple software product today has 
millions of lines of code that provide many places for bugs to hide. That's why 
our customers still encounter bugs despite the rigorous and extensive stress 
testing and beta testing we do. With Windows 2000 and Windows XP, we 
dramatically improved the stability and reliability of our platform, and we 
eliminated many flaws, but we did not find all the bugs in these or other 
products. Nor did we find all the software conflicts that can cause applications 
to freeze up or otherwise fail to perform as expected.<br>
<br>
The process of finding and fixing software problems has been hindered by a lack 
of reliable data on the precise nature of the problems customers encounter in 
the real world. Freeze-ups and crashes can be incredibly irritating, but rarely 
do customers contact technical support about them; instead, they close the 
program. Even when customers do call support and we resolve a problem, we often 
do not glean enough detail to trace its cause or prevent it from recurring.<br>
<br>
To give us better feedback, a small team in our Office group built a system that 
helps us gather real-world data about the causes of customers' problems - in 
particular, about crashes. This system is now built into Office, Windows, and 
most of our other major products, including our forthcoming Windows .NET 
Servers. It enables customers to send us an error report, if they choose, 
whenever anything goes wrong.<br>
<br>
There are risks in offering this option to have software &quot;phone home&quot; like E.T. 
One risk is that error reporting could compound a customer's irritation over the 
error itself. We therefore worked hard to make reporting simple and quick. We 
developed a special format, called a &quot;minidump,&quot; to minimize the size of the 
report so that it can be transferred in a few seconds with a single mouse click.<br>
<br>
Also, customers may wonder what we do with their reports and whether their 
privacy is protected. We use advanced security technologies to help protect 
these error reports, which are gathered on a cluster of dedicated Microsoft 
servers and are used for no other purpose than to find and fix bugs. Engineers 
look at stack details, some system information, a list of loaded modules, the 
type of exception, and global and local variables.<br>
<br>
We've been amazed by the patterns revealed in the error reports that customers 
are sending us. The reports identify bugs not only in our own software, but in 
Windows-based applications from independent hardware and software vendors as 
well. One really exciting thing we learned is how, among all the software bugs 
involved in reports, a relatively small proportion causes most of the errors. 
About 20 percent of the bugs cause 80 percent of all errors, and - this is 
stunning to me - one percent of bugs cause half of all errors.<br>
<br>
With this immensely valuable feedback from our customers, we're now able to 
prioritize debugging work on our products to achieve the biggest improvement in 
customers' experience. And as the work proceeds based on this new source of 
systematic data, the improvement will be dramatic. Already, in Windows XP 
Service Pack 1, error reporting enabled us to address 29 percent of errors 
involving the operating system and applications running on it, including a large 
number of third-party applications. Error reporting helped us to eliminate more 
than half of all Office XP errors with Office XP Service Pack 2.<br>
<br>
Work continues to find and fix remaining bugs in these and other existing 
products, but error reporting is now also helping us to resolve more problems 
before new products are released. Visual Studio .NET, released last February, 
was one of our first products to benefit from the use of error-reporting data 
throughout its beta testing. Error reporting enabled us to log and fix 74 
percent of all crashes reported in the first beta version. Many other problems 
were caught and eliminated in subsequent testing rounds.<br>
<br>
And we're not keeping this great tool to ourselves. We're working with 
independent hardware and software vendors to help them use our error-reporting 
data to improve their products, too. Some 450 companies have accessed our 
database of error reports related to their drivers, utilities and applications. 
Marked decreases in some types of errors have followed. Those involving 
third-party firewall software, for example, have dropped 67 percent since the 
first of the year. Also, we've created software that enables corporations to 
redirect error reports to their own servers, so that administrators can find and 
resolve the problems that are having the most impact on their systems.<br>
<br>
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING<br>
<br>
We're working to make error reporting a much more supple tool that provides 
helpful information to customers while enabling us to improve their experience 
in new ways. As we understand more errors, we're adding an option for customers 
to go to a Web site where they can learn more about and even fix the errors they 
report. In the future we want to enable customers to look up the history of 
their error reports and our efforts to resolve them. And we're trying to create 
easy ways for customers to send us more nuanced feedback about their experience 
with our products - not only about crashes, but also about features that don't 
work the way or as easily as people would like.<br>
<br>
Microsoft Error Reporting is just one of the ways in which we're trying to 
create broader customer connections. Another is through our software update and 
management services, which make it easy for customers to keep their software 
current. We're also making significant changes in our product service and 
support to enhance their value, and to speed the resolution of customer 
problems. Soon we will commit to a new policy that will give customers greater 
clarity and confidence about our support for products through their lifecycles.<br>
<br>
There's much more I would like to share with you about these and other 
initiatives on behalf of customers, but I wanted to be (relatively) brief. If 
you would like to know more, you'll find information and links to help you drill 
down even further at

<br>
Ultimately, we're trying to change how software developers do their jobs on a 
daily basis. We're working to establish more of a direct, interactive connection 
between developers and customers, leading to better software and happier 
customers. To get there, we intend to listen even more closely to our customers, 
consult with them regularly, and be more responsive. This is the message I am 
sending to all of Microsoft's employees, and it is my commitment to you.<br>
