<P>This short memo is not meant to cover all the thread area. It is merely
a bunch of notes and reflexions I had while venturing in the dangerous
but fascinating world of multi-threading programming. This article contains
some programming data but is mostly stuffed with dangerously non-technical
terms like "warm and fuzzy". Be warned.

<A NAME="THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEWING"></A>THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEWING</H3>
If you deliver libraries, you must have felt a pressing demand from you
customers for multi-thread support. However, the early signals will show
that they usually aren't quite sure about what they exactly want, or even,
what multi-threading is about at all. My guess is that it's usually more
like a query that emanate from their superiors, which they diligently forwarded
to their favorite component software suppliers. This falls in a category
I'd call "a box to check on a list". These managers have precise requirements
to meet, no matter how technically sound it might be (or not be). There
are many items that fall in this category, I will discuss about this in
some other memo, one day.

<P>Back to the issue. The first thing to realize about multi-threading,
with regard to libraries, is that it is a two-level process :
<OL>
<LI>
multi-thread safe</LI>

<LI>
multi-thread hot (a)</LI>
</OL>
These two steps must be performed in that order. In the early days, people
were mostly interested in just being multi-thread safe. I'm not sure this
was very much used in these days (see for example the multi-threaded version
of Xt, the Intrinsics, which caused great disarray in the development teams
in Boston, and ended up being used by almost nobody). The main reason for
this was probably the scarcity of thread implementations, and above all,
their sloppyness.

<P>At one point in time, things changed. I couldn't say for sure what the
trigger was (it could be Windows 95 and/or NT, offering stable thread implementations),
but suddenly, people started considering threads very seriously. Please
note that this predates Java. Java did bring an even broader exposure to
threads, but I'd say it was mostly responsible for people switching to
step 2), while the initial awareness was for step 1) only. More about this
later.

<P>Now, people would dig for older publications on various topics such
as reentrancy or deadlocks. While these areas had been explored in great
details in parallelism researches, they still hadn't found their true place
in the industrial computing world. Gone are these days. Multi-threading
is mainstream, for better or for worse.
<H3>
<A NAME="MT SAFETY"></A>MT SAFETY</H3>
Taking an object-oriented library to multi-thread safety uncovers an unexpectedly
high number of problems. The first one you ponder is on the very meaning
of "MT Safety". What does it mean for a library to be MT safe ? What is
an "MT safe function" ? Do all functions of the API have to be MT safe
in order for the whole framework to be MT safe ?

<P>Whole books could be written on this topic. I'd sum up my position with
a mixed answer : solve most of the problems with as little coding as possible.
100% has always been a bad figure in computing. You don't want to solve
100% of the problem, because the curve to this if you parameterize it with
coding is asymptotic. The closer you get to 100%, the longer it takes to
reach it. 80% is much more realistic. You can solve 80% of most problems
in a finite time of coding.

<P>So, you don't want all your public functions to be MT safe. Only some
of them. And for those, even with the best provisions, you will never be
safe from a malicious use. The bottom line is : you can never say that
a function is MT safe. But you can document in what conditions it should
be called, and what resources it uses (implying that these resources should
not be locked at the moment of the call, but it already takes a smart programmer
to make this deduction, so don't hesitate to be redundant in documenting).

<P>Uh... I just used a very usual word ("lock") in a rather uncommon place.
I guess a more detailed explanation is in order.
<H3>
<A NAME="SHARING FAIRLY"></A>SHARING FAIRLY</H3>
The first step to MT safety is make sure that common resources are used
rationally. I am not going to get into the definition of mutexes or semaphores.
If you don't know how these work and what their purpose is, you probably
didn't even read that far. You can think that MT safety is all about locking
carefully, and if you do that, you get a free lunch and can proceed to
more interesting businees. The reality is a bit less shiny. Too much locking
will ruin all your work.

<P>I might be a bit rude there, but I'd say I much prefer a very precisely
documented function that does the minimal locking work, rather than a barricaded
function that will preclude any accident from happening, but urging me
into buying a faster processor for my machine in doing so.

<P>This speed consideration is not very important in C++ because you can
design locking mechanisms that can be conditionally inlined when you are
in a shipping period. But Java raised the issue again, since conditional
code is very difficult to achieve on Windows environment developments (as
of today. I really hope things will change in a near future. Please Symantec,
Microsoft, IBM, Borland, Asymetrix, etc... : let us use some kind of preprocessor
on our sources before compiling them).

<P>Of course, in an ideal world, you can have your cake and eat it too
: use an unsafe function if you know what you are doing, or a safe one
if you can't predict the calling environment.

<P>This is an important issue, and offering this choice is just as important
in thread libraries. In order to enter Threadland, we had to devise our
own platform-independant thread library (none of the tools like Roguewave's
existed by then). It was very instructive, and since I wasn't the one who
wrote this library, I won't comment on how neat it is, and how clever some
of the mechanisms used in it are. There is however one point I'd like to
stress out : among the available classes are Safe Mutexes and Unsafe Mutexes.

<P>The distinction between "safe" and "unsafe" goes beyond this specific
example, based on mutexes. The general idea is : on a first approximation,
use safe mutexes everywhere. They will never crash, possibly block, and
may even leave a trace to let you know if the lock they are trying to get
is already locked by some other thread, patting you on the shoulder to
let you know maybe you don't understand the flow of your program as you
think and you might want to review it again.

<P>When you get a better grasp of what is going on, you might venture into
using unsafe mutexes, that will offer the best performance if used correctly.
Typically, sometimes your code will necessarily need to lock several times
the same resource. It might be safe to do so within the same instance or
thread, of a class, but not if some other instance/thread locks the object.
If you are in a private function (i.e. you know who is calling it), you
can "safely use the unsafe API".

<P>Why am I mentioning this ? The morale is that you must give the choice
to the user, because you alone cannot know how your API will be used. It
is already very difficult to write reusable API's and sometimes, users
will surprise you when trying to achieve things with your code you never
thought of. With multi-threading, you can assume even less than that, and
the only choice is : work with the user. Make them intimate with your multi-threaded
work by documenting, explaining, and offering choice as much as possible.
<H3>
<A NAME="NOT A PERFECT WORLD"></A>NOT A PERFECT WORLD</H3>
Things always fail. And the more complex they become, the more likely they
are to fail. Two programming shifts have appeared recently that contributed
to making development a much more complex process : distributing computing
and multi-threading.

<P>Distributed computing introduced the network as a possible point of
failure. It adds flexibility but also adds a lot of hassle on the programmer
who has to take into accounts a greater number of cases where the code
might fail. Basically, you can't assume any longer that calling a function
will succeed (by "succeed", I mean the program counter will reach the entry
point of the function, i.e. the code of this function will be executed).

<P>Multi-threading offers a slightly different facet. Two new problems
arise :
<UL>
<LI>
the possibility of a deadlock, already mentioned ;</LI>

<LI>
failing to acquire a lock (note that the "front-end problem" is actually
"simultaneously and safely accessing the same data", but this boils down
to getting a lock)</LI>
</UL>
Just like a remote call can fail in a distributed world, the lock you want
to acquire might not be ready when you need it. You now have a very difficult
question to ponder : what am I supposed to do ?

<P>In a simple world, you don't even bother. The thread API will leave
you no choice but blocking until the lock is freed by some other thread.
More sophisticated thread API's will offer you an alternative : the possibility
to "try a lock", that is, see if the resource can be locked and immediately
fail if it can't be. Let's consider both cases.
<UL>1) tryLock() doesn't exist</UL>

<UL>
<UL>Strangely enough, this imposed behavior is not that dramatic in most
cases, and it probably explains why tryLock() is not implemented everywhere.
The point is that very often, acquiring the lock is the only thing that
matters to your code. If you can't grab it, then there is no point in processing
any further since you are not supposed to do anything else. Thus, blocking
is quite logical.

<P>This used to be fine, but is not any longer as of today where graphic
user interfaces are so pervasive. At the very least, you will have to make
sure your application is still updating its graphics. Even if it's to do
nothing but show a hourglass. The user will tolerate your application being
frozen while it is trying to progress, but they will most likely at least
require their screen not to be filled with empty rectangles and the possibility
to cancel the action that doesn't seem feasible at the moment. And for
all this to happen, a portion of your code has to be alive in order to
process the graphic events. Moreover, this live portion of code must be
able to break the current attempt of locking. The safest and deadliest
way to do this is to kill the offending thread. A smoother one is to let
the blocking thread know that it should give up trying to get the lock
and give it an occasion to exit gracefully, releasing all the resources
it acquired so far. We are entering another very complex area of multi-threading
programming here (thread interruption), and it would deserve a full article
on its own.

<P>It's amazing how things go fast in the computing world. The previous
paragraph might lead you into thinking that the latest interface breakthrough
was from non-graphic interfaces to graphic interfaces. This is not quite
true. Progress is still being made in the GUI world, and a part of it comes
from multi-threading (another one comes from innovations like Microsoft's
flat buttons, but this is another topic). Do you remember the early versions
of Netscape ? Selecting a menu was done the "old" way on Unix. They would
grab the X server, interrupting any other ongoing action. This is no longer
the case. A menu can be selected while the HTML part of the browser is
still busy retrieving and displaying data over the network. I can't say
for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised to hear that a separate thread is
being used for each of these actions.

<P>The morale is : if you can't test a lock, it makes programming simpler
(you don't have to ask yourself questions) but it results in restrictions
in your application that users tolerate less and less each day.</UL>
</UL>

<UL>2) tryLock() exists</UL>

<UL>
<UL>It is a well-established rule in computer science that the easier the
task is for the programmer, the more difficult the resulting application
will be for the end-user. Put differently, the more complex the code you
write is, the more likely it will end up being easy for the user.

<P>tryLock() is one of these many apparently harmless functionalities that
can drive a programmer crazy. From the previous section, it is pretty clear
that tryLock() should be used wherever possible, but it turns out that
it raises unbelievably complex issues which the programmer is sometimes
better off ignoring completely...

<P>The whole problem boils down to : what if tryLock() returns false, which
means that calling lock() will block the thread ? Note that it is not a
failure indication. The message here is not "the resource is not available",
but rather "the resource is not currently available". It makes a difference
because it is a warning much more than an error. The difference is relatively
small, though, because all it does is adding one possible split in the
flow of your program :
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>a) should I try again until I get what I want (possibly performing
some action in the meantime) ?
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<UL>b) should I fail ?
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
Option a) might look like you should actually use lock(), but it is actually
very different. The key point here is that unlike lock(), you are given
the opportunity to take whatever action you deem necessary in order for
your tryLock() to eventually succeed. For example, try another printer,
another network port to connect to, or even simply wait for some server
to be launched by a third party (for example, in CORBA, servers can be
activated in different modes, among which shared and non-shared. You might
want to try a shared server first and if it's busy, ask for a non-shared
server to be spawned.).

<P>Option b) is the most difficult to handle. If the resource you were
trying to acquire was essential to your application, you are now in a state
that is close to terminal. This problem will look familiar to people who
have been following the evolution of C++ for some time. Long ago, Stroustrup
and the C++ committee were working on exceptions, and were considering
the problem of resumption. When an exception is thrown, should the language
give some means to resume the execution of the program, or should it just
help propagate the exception and no more ? After lenghty discussions, it
was eventually decided that C++ would not allow exception resumption. I
refer you to Stroustrup's book (see the References section) for the exact
details of the decision.

<P>Someone said "he who doesn't learn history is condemned to repeat it".
I happen to think that organizational committees like C++' can't be wrong.
You might not agree with me, but if you read the aforementioned book, you
will at least have to admit the technical soundness of the arguments. It
was not a political choice, but a technical one, weighing carefully all
the pros and cons of each approach.</UL>
</UL>
So... what we have here is a singularly contradictory situation :
<UL>
<LI>
we should use tryLock() whenever possible ;</LI>

<LI>
tryLock() is extremely hard to handle gracefully but some can be learned
from exceptions.</LI>
</UL>
The bottom line : it is very dependant on the level of flexibility you
are willing to offer to the user. It's all a matter of trade-offs. In the
last resort, don't hesitate to shift the decision toward the user (by popping
a dialog or something similar). Most of the time, they will be the only
one that can make the right choice. But bear in mind that resuming a failed
execution is not always easy, and making this possible will force your
code into a certain design that must be carefully thought in the first
place.
<H3>
<A NAME="GOING MULTITHREADED"></A>GOING MULTITHREADED</H3>
This section is a very short list of gross recipes in order to switch into
the multi-threaded world.

<P>Your first enemy is static (global) variables. You have to spot them
all (c) and track them throughout their code. The first step is to guard
them with mutexes, but this is definitely not a systematic process. You
have to stare at your code until you are certain that the code you see
is not having unseen effects on other parts of the library. And with statics,
you never can tell for sure.&nbsp; Especially if the code you are writing
is destined to go into a shared library, which has its own rules for initializing
static parts of the program. If you write code for a library, always make
sure it will work both in a static and a shared libraries.

<P>I will make a short parenthese on the Singleton design pattern, which
many programmers use. If you don't use this design pattern yet and tend
to prefer static functions, you might want to think again. I strongly recommend
you avoid the following code :
<UL>
<PRE>A::Function1();</PRE>

<PRE>A::Function2();</PRE>

<PRE>A::Function3();</PRE>
</UL>
and use instead
<UL>
<PRE>A::GetSingleton().function1();</PRE>

<PRE>A::GetSingleton().function2();</PRE>

<PRE>A::GetSingleton().function3();</PRE>
</UL>
The idea is pretty obvious : cut down the number of static functions in
your API. Make them converge as much as possible toward a unique function,
on which you can focus your protection efforts. Once again, the underlying
goal is : choice. If you decided to make GetSingleton() a mutex-protected
function, you might want to supply an UnsafeGetSingleton() function that
will skip the mutex check and document precisely in what conditions this
function should be used.

<P>In the thread litterature, you will see a lot of concern about deadlocks.
Indeed, this is the first drawback that comes to people's mind about multi-threaded
programming. My experience might be biased on this, but I am not sure this
is the issue at stake here. Most (not to say all) of the problems I faced
with multi-thread were not due to interblocking, or starvation. What happened
most of the time was due to memory.

<P>There shows my bias. If I mention memory problems, I can't possibly
be using Java. That's right. I was using C++. Java makes all this discussion
moot since you will never meet early deallocation problem with Java. You
are still confronted with another kind of problems, but I'll get back to
this below.

<P>Back to C++ and memory problems. Most of the problems you will face
will stem from deallocated memory which you are still accessing, or other
problems of that kind. Sorry, no silver bullet to offer here, you are really
on your own. Tools like Purify and likes are priceless at this point. You
will probably find out that containers of pointers are a major pain, and
that you really have to take measures to handle them cleanly (let it be
addition or removal of elements), and most of all, that you have to make
your destructors sturdy as concrete.

<P>Maybe you assumed I had a silver bullet to offer at some point, according
to the wording I used above. Well, I lied. I really have no silver bullet.
Neither on C++, nor on Java. Especially because the litterature is abundant
on this latter. You will definitely want to take a look at Doug Lea's book
"Concurrent programming in Java". I find the overall work a bit messy and
in need of some ordering, but each part taken separately is filled with
insightful advice that will give you a crash course in deadlocks and related
issues in no time.
<H3>
<A NAME="THREADING MODELS"></A>THREADING MODELS</H3>
Let us take a quick ride into the very technical area. Concretely, let's
examine the examples of a mono-threaded model and a multi-threaded one.
I will use what I am most familiar with : Orbix.

<P>The recent versions of Orbix offered multi-threading. At level two,
that is, "multi-thread hot". This is especially meant to be used on the
server side.

<P>The mono-threaded model is very simple, and quite common in client-server
applications : the server listens to several file descriptors simultaneously,
and dispatches the incoming messages to the appropriate object implementations.
Selection is based both on the file description number, and on more specific
information contained in the data that was just received (the effective
type of the object, what function, what parameters, etc...).

<P>The first design revamp you might be tempted to make is : one client,
one thread. You break multiplexing and spawn one thread per file descriptor.
Orbix takes the paradigm one step further (b) by allowing
<UL>
<LI>
one thread per object ;</LI>

<LI>
one thread per request.</LI>
</UL>
However neat and flexible these offers are, I will stick to the simplest
part (one thread per client) and carry on with my example.

<P>Incoming requests all reach a central point in the server, where the
request is unmarshalled, and then forwarded to the right dispatcher, which
then proceeds to dispatch it to the right function. In order to accomodate
the different models, you can wedge in your own "request unmarshaller",
and therefore, get a chance to examine the request before it is effectively
dispatched. The idea behing the whole design is to create your own dispatcher
and tell Orbix not to take care of these requests.

<P>Basically, you will create a new thread at each new connection, and
each of these threads will then "block" on a "queue" (more about this below).
When a request hits your server, your request marshaller is invoked and
asked to examine the request. If you choose to leave it, it will be handed
to the next request unmarshaller, otherwise, the request becomes your sole
responsibility and Orbix proceeds to read the next request from the network.

<P>Your unmarshaller will unfold the request and transmit it to the right
thread. Since you are now "in-process" (that is, in the same process),
it is no longer a matter of listening to a file descriptor. At the thread
level, threads block on what is most commonly referred to as a "condition
variable". This condition variable is an indicator of the current status
of the private queue of requests of the thread. As long as the queue is
empty, the thread sleeps. If awakened by the main dispatcher thread, the
sleeping thread awakens, spins the queue, processes all pending requests,
and gets back to sleep when it is done.

<P>As you can see, the resulting design is fairly complex with respect
to the monothreaded one. And indeed, it takes some time and a reasonable
amount of aspirine to put it to work. Another vexing point is that your
goal is not to enhance the existing process, but merely to make it work
just as well as the mono-threaded one. This is pretty similar to the daily
job of a system administrator : when they do their job correctly, nobody
notices anything, things just go smoothly.

<P>But in the end, when it works, you really end up with the impression
that you master the inner workings of your framework. And before I went
multi-threaded, I wasn't sure I could have said this of any application
I had ever developed before.
<H3>
<A NAME="JAVA"></A>JAVA</H3>
Java offers a very attractive range of functionalities, both old and new.
But most of all, it exposed programmers to multi-threading. So far, only
a fairly small subset of developers had tackled the issue. Now, it's very
hard not to use threads when programming in Java. Threads pop up at the
very least occasion : if you want to monitor several file descriptors,
if you want to post timer events, etc...

<P>What's nice is that Java's thread API is simple and powerful. It is
not free from design and implementation mistakes, as have shown the recent
discussion on termination of threads on the Java mailing-list (in short
: it is broken, and the current API is being deprecated), but it raises
the overall awareness of everyone on the issue. Most of all, it created
a standard naming for thread discussions, kind of like Design Patterns
(the book) coined the major terms we use every day in our discussions now.
<H3>
<A NAME="WHAT DO THREADS BUY ME ?"></A>WHAT DO THREADS BUY ME ?</H3>
Once again, I don't want to go over a carefully detailed analysis of the
pros and cons of multi-threading. Plenty of material on the topic exists.
I just want to stress a few "social" points that I only rarely saw addressed.

<P>When asked about switching to multi-threading, most experienced programmers
(but not familiar with the issue) will invariably respond that everything
that can be done with several threads can be done just as well with one
process, possibly multiplexing and decoupling on an incoming stream of
events.

<P>This is the standard answer, and is touted and loudly advocated by respectable
people like John Ousterhout. This is a very reasonable answer, and actually,
there are even works backing up this thread denial in terms of performances,
like Doug Schmidt's findings (roughly put : multi-threaded servers are
not necessarily faster than mono-threaded ones). Granted, most of the time,
you are better off without threads. But it doesn't cover "all" the time.
"Sometimes", evenemential programmation just won't cut it.

<P>Consider a server that is being accessed by several dozens of clients.
The server manipulates several millions of objects, and sometimes has to
create objects on clients in response to their queries (a fairly common
situation at some of our customers sites). Two situations can block the
server in a mono-threading world :
<UL>
<LI>
the creation of remote objects is synchronous. The server has to wait for
the answer from the client "the object is constructed, here is its reference,
now you can call functions on it". Then it can carry on ;</LI>

<LI>
the in-process time spent to service a request is long. Bear in mind that
"long" is very relative. One second is an eternity in the kind of environment
I described in this example. It means that the calling client is being
blocked (which can be acceptable) but that all others can't be serviced
either (which is not).</LI>
</UL>
Forking is not an option. However efficient "forkness" has become with
the advent of functions such as vfork(), it is still an order of magnitude
above threads. And sharing resources with forked processes comes with its
own set of problems, which we don't want to consider here.

<P>Multi-threading programming is not just a fancy. Its benefits are undoubtedly
very exaggerated, but you just can't afford ignoring the matter any more,
because sometimes, it is the only acceptable solution to a problem.
<H3>
<A NAME="I AM STILL NOT CONVINCED"></A>I AM STILL NOT CONVINCED</H3>
All you will get in this paragraph is how I personally feel about this
whole issue. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

<P>Several months after working on this and eventually shipping the project,
I came down to a halt and pondered what I had just done. And I was strangely
satisfied. Much more satisfied than "visually appealing applications" I
had written before, and of which I was rather proud as well. No, strangely
enough, what I really appreciated about this is that it's invisible. Nobody
but me knows how complex the inner workings of what I developed is. The
worst is that the shipped product behaves just the same as its former version.
It adds a few functionalities, thanks to "multi-thread hotness" (or should
I say "heat" ?). But apart from that, it can barely be distinguished from
its predecessor.

<P>But what is going inside is mindbogglingly complex and sometimes led
me to really agitated nights. But I documented it extensively. I needed
to. Because however complex it is, it works, and it's not by accident.
It involved rethinking a major part of the initial library, and reshaping
it in a very alien way. It's a design that is necessarily "up to bottom".
You have to design it in your head first, unlike most of the everyday programming
where you can afford building piece of code by piece of code once the design
has been approved by your team. Somehow, it takes the code review process
down one level : it used to be performed by the team, now you need to do
it by yourself and for yourself.

<P>Programming is an abstract art, but compared with multi-threading programming,
mono-threading programming looks very concrete. I used to see only concrete
things. Now I see both. And I never programmed the same way again. Programming
to multi-threads is an extremely rewarding experience, and you really end
up feeling warm and fuzzy inside. You can question its use, but the beauty
is not in it being the end to all. It's just cool. And if this doesn't
convince you, nothing will.

<P>At the very least, now you know I was serious about the "warm and fuzzy"
part.

(a) I don't like "hot". I tend to favor "active", but any other idea is
welcome.

<P>(b) This is not an Orbix advertisement. Orbix just happens to offer
the most flexible thread models among all currently existing ORBs. My disclaimer
will be twofold : 1) other ORBs will most likely appear shortly with models
at least as flexibls as Orbix' and 2) Orbix has many other shortcomings.

<P>(c) A consistent naming of static variables and functions helps a lot
in such situations, like capitalizing their name.
