<p>Last night, I received a map of the world for my thirty-third birthday, and 
it was the most extraordinary gift I&nbsp; ever received.&nbsp; Even now, I am 
still coming to terms with the whole story.&nbsp; Do you want to know why?&nbsp; 
Then read on.&nbsp; What follows is the story of a prank that spans over 
eighteen months, involved the participation of dozens of participants and 
contributed to hours of discussion.&nbsp; As for me, it simply represents one of 
these moments in a lifetime that you know you will remember for years.</p>
<p>But first, we need to take a little trip back in time...</p>
<p><b>In the beginning</b></p>
<p>About a year ago, in February 2001, I received a birthday card in the mail.&nbsp; 
I wasn't exactly surprised by this, even though my birthday was -- January 2nd 
-- was about a month old.&nbsp; This birthday card had been sent from a place in 
America which was not San Francisco (sorry, I can't remember where) but its most 
startling particularity was in the sender.&nbsp; Or lack thereof.</p>
<p>The card was anonymous.</p>
<p>I flipped it over several times, reached for the envelope which I had 
discarded, but I couldn't find any indication of who the mysterious was.&nbsp; 
Thinking it was a simple oversight and that I would probably never know, I threw 
the card away.&nbsp; If I had only known...</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, another anonymous birthday card showed up.&nbsp; The writing 
was the same one, it was postmarked from another place in America, but then 
again, held no signature and no hint.&nbsp; In the coming month, four of these 
cards landed in my mailbox, and I was seriously beginning to think that there 
was more to it than met the eye.&nbsp; And then, a recollection struck me.</p>
<p><b>Moving further into the dark</b></p>
<p>At my previous company, my coworkers had developed a strange habit.&nbsp; As 
we tended to hang out a lot and go out as a group, one of them (Martin I 
believe) found it funny to tell the restaurant that it was my birthday.&nbsp; 
From that day on, it has become a tradition to celebrate my birthday on any day 
of the year as long as it's not January 2nd.</p>
<p>After our project disbanded, the little group scattered away and the 
tradition stopped.&nbsp; But this series of incident brought it back to my 
memory.&nbsp; Two people immediately came to mind:&nbsp; Elliot and Marcus, whom 
I happen to hang out with a lot.&nbsp; Of course, a cursory interrogation 
revealed nothing but I kept them on my short list of suspects, along with 
Martin.&nbsp; Marcus and Elliot are known to pull this kind of prank, and be 
pretty good at it, as I can testify (I will save the &quot;Propecia prank&quot; for 
another time).</p>
<p>As time went back, more and more cards kept arriving, at the approximate pace 
of three a month.&nbsp; Half of them came from America and the other half, from 
the rest of the world:&nbsp; Moscow, Autralia, Kenya, Ireland, South Africa, 
Antarctica, Hong-Kong,&nbsp; South America, etc...&nbsp; At this point, I was no 
longer throwing the cards away.&nbsp; I religiously stored them after a quick 
analysis.</p>
<p><b>Card Scene Investigation</b></p>
<p>Of course, I did my best to get as much information from the cards themselves 
as I could.&nbsp; Here is a typical envelope:</p>
<p>And a card:</p>
<p>The handwriting on the card was rigorously the same for all of them but two.&nbsp; 
One of these anomalies was written with a typo on my first name and the other 
one is the card from Hong Kong.&nbsp; This card shares a characteristic with 
another one:&nbsp; unlike all the others, it was not written by the Master Mind 
but really by a resident.</p>
<p>But let's get back to the card themselves, because they do reveal something.&nbsp; 
I noticed that the sevens were crossed.&nbsp; This is very unusual for any 
native English speaker.&nbsp; Whether it be America, Great Britain or Australia, 
natives of these countries usually don't cross their sevens.&nbsp; This 
reinforced my conviction that the Master Mind could be of French influence, 
something that of the three suspects on my short list, only Martin matched.&nbsp; 
But still, it wasn't enough for me to discard the other two since they could 
definitely have altered their writing to throw me off.&nbsp; And even do so 
consistently over forty cards and a one year period.</p>
<p>The birthday cards themselves were fairly random.&nbsp; I don't think the 
Master Mind was trying to communicate some kind of message, or it he/she did, I 
never made sense of it.&nbsp; I noticed that most of these cards were from 
Hallmark, which pointed me toward an American perpetrator.&nbsp; Granted, it 
wasn't such a clue but when the Master Mind caught wind of this remark, they 
slightly changed their tactics and started buying cards from more varied 
origins.</p>
<p>After a while, I would only pay a very cursory attention to the cards 
themselves and simply stocked them up with the others, hoping I would one day 
find the key to this riddle.</p>
<p><b>Fast forward</b></p>
<p>Advance to the present time.&nbsp; In the week that followed my birthday in 
2002, nothing new happened, to my great disappointment.&nbsp; I did receive two 
more cards during this period but the place they were sent from (Mexico and 
America) ruled out any kind of planning.&nbsp; Besides, none of them 
differentiated itself from the others.</p>
<p>And then we reach Friday, January 25th, 2002.</p>
<p>I was supposed to play a game of broom ball on that night (in case you don't 
know, this game is played in an ice rink with sneakers, brooms and a lot of 
padding).&nbsp; Elliot picked me up at 7:45 and we headed for the ice rink.</p>
<p>Well, not quite.&nbsp; He told me he first needed to get his gear from a 
friend's place.&nbsp; We chat on the way there and I notice that this friend 
must be living very close to Melissa's, a common friend of Elliot's and myself.&nbsp; 
I decide to wait in the car but as Elliot is headed for the house, he seems to 
change his mind and tell me to join him.</p>
<p>My density level was at its highest at this point.</p>
<p>I followed him up to Melissa's place, still not really paying much attention 
to what's going on and next thing I know, I'm in a room filled by about thirty 
very familiar faces.&nbsp; I am quickly hustled inside, unable to utter a simple 
word.&nbsp; Some people who know me really well told me they had never seen me 
so shocked.&nbsp; Shocked doesn't even begin to describe my state of mind at 
this moment.</p>
<p>As I grab a cup, Kim (Marcus' wife) tells me they have a gift for me.&nbsp; 
She hands me a long cylindrical wrapped object, which is obviously a map of some 
sort.&nbsp; I unfold the document on the floor and my heart starts pounding as I 
am finally realizing that in front of me lies the answer to the riddle that has 
been puzzling me for over a year now.</p>
<p><b>Small world</b></p>
<p>The plastic map features about forty numbered stickers representing the 
locations where the postcards were sent from.&nbsp; Along, I receive two sheets 
of paper with a summary of the people who were involved in the year-long scam 
and the locations.&nbsp; Some of these cards were sent and never arrived and 
others were never sent at all.</p>
<p>But the question still remains...&nbsp; Who came up with this scheme?&nbsp; 
Who could have not only the prankster mind to conceive such a devilish plan but 
most of all, the resilience to carry it out through a full year?</p>
<p>A girl of course :-)</p>
<p>The Master Mind is none other than Kim.&nbsp; From there, it's easy to piece 
everything up.&nbsp; Kim has been to enough &quot;Coolcats Events&quot; to know about the 
tradition and if I had even considered her, she would probably have struck me as 
able to come up with such an incredible scam.&nbsp; But the thing is...&nbsp; 
she never even entered my radar.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it's not very hard to accomplish this kind of feat.&nbsp; 
All you need is to keep your ears open and ask whoever you hear mentions they 
are traveling abroad to post a card for you.</p>
<p>Just because it's materially easy doesn't mean everybody can do it.&nbsp; I 
am still so impressed that Kim was able to plot and sustain this idea for a year 
that words fail me just when I think about it.</p>
<p><b>Random events</b></p>
<p>Throughout the surprise party, I managed to collect more pieces of evidence 
and a series of events and recollections started forming in my mind.&nbsp; I had 
been taken on quite a trip, indeed.&nbsp; Here are some random events that have 
happened over this past year:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The surprise party organization was a little gem for a certain number of 
  reasons.&nbsp; First of all, it seems I'm a person who's pretty hard to nail 
  at a place and a time.&nbsp; Several times, Elliot, Marcus and Kim tried to 
  lure me to pseudo-parties but I always ended up not being able to make it or 
  having already made other plans.&nbsp; Elliot finally managed to tag along for 
  the broom ball game.&nbsp; The only problem is that he didn't know Mary, the 
  person who was organizing it.&nbsp; That didn't stop him from emailing her 
  directly, asking if he could join us.&nbsp; The next day, I received Mary's 
  reply to Elliot saying he was welcome.<br>
  <br>
  It seems harmless enough, right?<br>
  <br>
  Well, here is what really happened:&nbsp; right after he asked her to join the 
  game (while innocently CC'ing me), Elliot sent her another email telling her 
  about the surprise party and how not only he would not come to the game, but 
  that I wouldn't either.&nbsp; Mary seems to have liked the idea since she took 
  the time to send that next fake email the next day to confirm that we were 
  both welcome.<br>
  <br>
  What were my odds of figuring anything out faced with such opposition, uh?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I moved&nbsp; to a new place six months ago.&nbsp; I mentioned my new 
  address to my friends around me and I was not exactly surprised to see the 
  birthday cards start arriving at my new address a few weeks later.&nbsp; Kim 
  did keep sending the cards at the old address for a little while, though, 
  probably to throw me off even further.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you haven't seen the movie &quot;Amelie&quot;, I have two things to tell you:&nbsp; 
  1) You absolutely must see this film.&nbsp; I guarantee that you will come out 
  of the theater with a wide smile on your face.&nbsp; And 2) Skip to the next 
  bullet point:&nbsp; what follows is a minor spoiler for the movie.<br>
  <br>
  In this movie, Amelie's father is very fond of a garden gnome.&nbsp; He also 
  happens to be very afraid of traveling, something that bothers Amelie.&nbsp; 
  So she decides to play a little trick on him:&nbsp; she hands the gnome to one 
  of her friends, who happens to be a flight attendant.&nbsp; This friend takes 
  the gnome all over the world and sends pictures of it with famous monuments 
  across the globe back to her Dad.<br>
  <br>
  The resemblance is striking, uh?&nbsp; Well, it is just a coincidence.&nbsp; 
  Kim came up with this idea by herself.&nbsp; Actually, the irony is that I 
  watched Amelie with her just a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Of course, I appreciated 
  the movie for the obvious reason, but I can hardly imagine how she felt on the 
  way back home :-)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
