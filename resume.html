<h3>Overview</h3>

I was an early member of the Android team at Google and and I'm the tech lead for the Gmail client.

<p>
I have more than twenty years of experience in software engineering in the industry.  My work at BEA has provided me with a great visibility in the Java Enterprise community where I am often regarded as an expert in the domain.  I am frequently solicited for interviews and conferences where I am invited to expose my views on certain problems and to discuss the trends of the industry.

<p>

I am heavily involved in the Java community and over the years, I worked on various JSR's that helped shape the future of the the Java platfor, such as JSR 175 (annotations for Java), JSR 201 (extensions to the Java language) and JSR 220 (EJB 3.0).

<p>
I maintain <a href="http://beust.com/weblog">a blog</a> where I post on a regular basis about a variety of technical subjects.

<p>
In 2004, I created <a href="http://testng.org">TestNG</a>, an open source Java testing framework that has seen a lot of adoption, especially in the web testing area.  <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/testng-users">The mailing-list</a> gathers more than 2000 members and I'm still actively working on this framework on my spare time to support the community.
<p>
Finally, I published two books, the latest one being <a href="http://testng.org/doc/book.html">"Next Generation Java Testing"</a>, which covers testing techniques for Java development.

<li>
<b>May 98 - Oct 99, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.htm">Sun Microsystems</a></b>
<br>
Mountain View, CA
<br>
I worked at SunLabs on the Persona project, a small device that acts as a universal answering machine, centralizing voice mail, emails, faxes, etc... and making them accessible from anywhere. I was in charge of developing back-end services and improving the communication framework (Java and C++).
Then we switched to the Consumer and Embedded Division where we have been working on set-top boxes (devices connected to the television enabling Web surfing and other various online activities like email, address book, etc...) and Internet screen phones.

<p>
<li>
<b>Feb 96 - Feb 98, <a href="http://www.ilog.com">ILog</a></b>
<br>
Sophia Antipolis, France
<br>
I worked in the R&D department of Ilog, where I developed C++ and Java components implementing GUI's for distributed libraries, using CORBA and other various networking frameworks (more details on my CORBA work can be found at http://beust.com/cedric/corba-work.html).

<p>
<li>
<b>1994-1996, PhD in Bull's Koala team. Topic : <a href="http://www.inria.fr/koala">Distributed Computing and GUI</a></b>
<br>
Sophia Antipolis, France 
<br>
 
I developed two "message buses" (message oriented middleware a la Sun's Tooltalk) which have been used by Bull and some other companies (like the French Civil Aviation). I also worked with very early versions of CORBA by the end of my PhD. Main languages used: C, C++. 


</ul>


<h3>Technical profile</h3>

<ul>

<li>I have been programming in Java since 1996. My interests in semi chronological order:
<ul>
<li>Server front end and back end technologies (GWT, Guice, servlets, ORM, etc...)
<li>Mobile development (Android)
<li>Enterprise JavaBeans (development of an EJB 2.0 EJB container for WebLogic Server)
<li>Graphic User Interfaces (Swing, SWT) and usability.
<li>Aspect-Oriented Programming
<li>Programming languages, software testing, design patterns and object oriented programming.
</ul>

<br>

<li>
6 years experience C++
<br>
For several years, I was part of the C++ Committee and attended some of their meetings, discussing the norm and various other C++ related matters.

<br>
<br>
<li>
CORBA and distributed computing
<br>

5 years experience CORBA (Orbix, OrbixWeb, PowerBroker)
I essentially use IONA products, but sometimes switch to different ORBs, mainly for ports and comparative benchmarks (including non-CORBA technologies like RMI, Objectspace's Voyager, etc...). 

<br>
<br>
<li> 
Familiar with Microsoft's COM, DCOM, ATL, etc...
I have also been working with Microsoft technologies using Visual C++ and Visual J++. My developments made use of COM, DCOM, ATL, MFC, etc...

<br>
<br>

Spent mostly half time, working for the University of Nice, helping the system administration staff to keep the basic services running. 


</ul>


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

I co-authored two books:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Next-Generation-Java-Testing-Advanced/dp/0321503104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1266945525&sr=8-1">Next Generation Java Testing (2007)</a>.  This book is based on my experience with TestNG, the testing framework I created.  It covers a very wide range of Java technologies and how to test them efficiently using clean design patterns and pragmatic methodologies.

<br>

<br>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Java-Server-Programming-J2EE/dp/1861005377/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1266945781&sr=1-1">Professional Java Server Programming J2EE (2001)</a>. I wrote the five chapters dedicated to EJB 2.0, exploring in depth the new specification. Since I am part of the team that developed the WebLogic EJB container, I go in great details in these chapters about how to build a robust mission-critical application.

</ul>


Hobbies: golf (I used to play at national level), squash, snowboard, tennis, volleyball, scuba diving.
