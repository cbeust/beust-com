          <p>
              In this example, we'll write a Kobalt plug-in that simply counts the number of source files and lines in your project.
              Starting from scratch, we'll have this plug-in published to JCenter and ready to use in ten minutes.
          </p>

          <p>
              Let's start by creating our project:
          </p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ mkdir linecount
$ cd linecount
$ mkdir -p src/main/kotlin/com/beust/kobalt/plugin/linecount
$ $KOBALT_HOME/kobaltw --init kotlin
</pre>

<p>
  <code>./kobaltw --init kotlin</code> creates an empty Kotlin project. Since we will be publishing this project to a Maven repository, we need to make sure that its <code>group</code>, <code>artifactId</code> and <code>version</code> are correct. The only thing that the generator can't guess is the <code>group</code>, so let's go ahead and fix it:
</p>

<pre class="brush:java">
val project = project {
    name = "kobalt-line-count"
    group = "com.beust.kobalt"
    artifactId = name
    version = "0.1"
    ...
</pre>
          <p>
              We also need to add Kobalt Plug-in API as a dependency:
          </p>
          <pre class="brush:java">
    dependencies {
        compile("com.beust:kobalt-plugin-api:")
    }</pre>

<p>
  Next, we need to create our <code>kobalt-plugin.xml</code> file in the <code>src/main/resources/META-INF</code> directory.
    Once there, it will be automatically copied in the right place in our jar file:
</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">
&lt;kobalt-plugin&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;kobalt-line-count&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;plugin-actors&gt;
        &lt;class-name&gt;com.beust.kobalt.plugin.linecount.LineCountPlugin&lt;/class-name&gt;
    &lt;/plugin-actors&gt;
&lt;/kobalt-plugin&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  Now we're ready to code.
</p>

<p>
  Let's start by writing the simplest plug-in we can:
</p>

<pre class="brush:java">
// LineCountPlugin.kt
package com.beust.kobalt.plugin.linecount

import com.beust.kobalt.api.*

class LineCountPlugin : BasePlugin() {
    override val name = "kobalt-line-count"

    override fun apply(project: Project, context: KobaltContext) {
        println("*** Applying plugin $name with project $project")
    }
}
</pre>

          <p>
              Before we can upload it, we need to create the package in bintray, <a href="https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_creatinganewpackage.html">as explained here</a>. Once this is done, we are ready to do our first upload:
          </p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ ./kobaltw uploadBintray
...
========== kobalt-line-count:uploadBintray
  Found 12 artifacts to upload:
    Uploading 12 / 12 |............|
BUILD SUCCESSFUL (15 seconds)
</pre>

<p>
  If you go to the maven section of your bintray account, you will now see that the new package has two unpublished files. Your new plug-in won't be visible by clients until you publish those files, so let's update our build file to automatically publish files from now on:
</p>

<pre class="brush:java">
bintray {
    publish = true
}
</pre>

          <p>
              And now, let's implement our logic, which is pretty simple:
          </p>

<pre class="brush:java">
// LineCountPlugin.kt
@Task(name = "lineCount", description = "Count the lines", runBefore = arrayOf("compile"))
fun lineCount(project: Project): TaskResult {
  var fileCount = 0
  var lineCount : Long = 0
  val matcher = FileSystems.getDefault().getPathMatcher("glob:**.kt")
  project.sourceDirectories.forEach {
    val path = Paths.get(it)
    if (Files.isDirectory(path)) {
      Files.walkFileTree(path, object : SimpleFileVisitor&lt;Path&gt;() {
        override fun visitFile(path: Path, attrs: BasicFileAttributes): FileVisitResult {
          if (matcher.matches(path)) {
            fileCount++
            lineCount += Files.lines(path).count()
          }
          return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE
        }
      })
    }
  }
  log(1, "Found $lineCount lines in $fileCount files")
  return TaskResult()
}
</pre>

          <p>
              We create a task called <code>"lineCount"</code> in which we look for all files ending in ".kt" in all the source directories of the project. Finally, we display a count of files and lines at the end by using <code>log()</code>, which is automatically supplied by the Kobalt API:
          </p>

<pre class="brush:java">
class LineCountPlugin : BasePlugin() {
</pre>

          <p>
              Let's bump our version to 0.2 (since version 0.1 is already uploaded and Bintray won't allow us to overwrite it) and upload our new plug-in:
          </p>


<pre class="brush:plain">
$ ./kobaltw uploadBintray
...
kobalt-line-count: Compilation succeeded
========== kobalt-line-count:assemble
Created /Users/beust/kotlin/kobalt-line-count/kobaltBuild/libs/kobalt-line-count-0.2.jar
========== kobalt-line-count:generatePom
 Wrote /Users/beust/kotlin/kobalt-line-count/kobaltBuild/libs/kobalt-line-count-0.2.pom
========== kobalt-line-count:uploadBintray
  Found 12 artifacts to upload:
    Uploading 12 / 12 |............|
BUILD SUCCESSFUL (15 seconds)
</pre>

<p>
  Finally, let's use our plug-in from another project. Since we didn't link this project to JCenter, it's uploaded in the user's maven repository, so we will have to add this maven repository to the build file where we want to use the plug-in. Adjust this line to point to your own maven repo:
</p>

<pre class="brush:java">
val bs = buildScript {
    repos("https://dl.bintray.com/cbeust/maven/")
    plugins("com.beust:kobalt-line-count:0.2")
}
</pre>

          <p>
              Now let's launch a build:
          </p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
$ ./kobaltw assemble
...
========== kobalt:lineCount
Found 4972 lines in 65 files
========== kobalt:compile
...
</pre>

          <p>
              Note that our plugin ran before the <code>compile</code> task, as we requested in the <code>@Task</code> annotation. We can also verify that it's activated and we can invoke the task directly instead of having it run as part of the build:
          </p>

<pre class="brush:java">
$ ./kobaltw --tasks
  ===== kobalt-line-count =====
    lineCount		Count the lines
$ ./kobaltw lineCount
Found 4972 lines in 65 files
</pre>

          <p>
              And that's it! You can now iterate on your plug-in and upload it with additional <code>./kobaltw uploadBintray</code>. This plug-in is <a href="https://github.com/cbeust/kobalt-linecount">available on github</a>. Note that the plug-in in the repo
              illustrates a few other concepts not discussed here, such as adding dynamic tasks, so I encourage you take a look at its source.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section" id="initialization">Initialization</h2>
          <p>
              When your plug-in is activated, Kobalt will invoke its <code>apply()</code> function:
          </p>
<pre class="brush:java">
override fun apply(project: Project, context: KobaltContext) {
}
</pre>
          <p>
              <code>project</code> is the project that your plug-in is currently being initialized for (keep in mind there can be multiple projects in a build) and the <code>context</code> gives you some information about other external data you might find useful, such as the command line that was passed to Kobalt.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section" id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
          <p>
              The simplest way to run your plug-in in your IDE is to create a main function in the main class of your
              plug-in as follows:
          </p>
<pre class="brush:java">
fun main(argv: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    com.beust.kobalt.main(argv)
}

class LineCountPlugin : BasePlugin() {
// ...
</pre>

          <p>
              Now you can simply create a launch configuration for your main class, which will invoke Kobalt.
          </p>

<p>
  The next step is to have Kobalt invoke your plug-in, so you will have to modify your build file
  to call it. As long as you haven't deployed your plug-in to Bintray, you might want to use the
  <code>file()</code> directive to declare your dependency, so that Kobalt will use the jar file
  on your file system:
</p>

<pre class="brush:java">
val bs = buildScript {
    plugins(
        file(homeDir("kotlin/kobalt-line-count/kobaltBuild/libs/kobalt-line-count-0.2.jar")))
}</pre>

          <p>
              You can now set a breakpoint in your plug-in and launch the configuration you created above.
          </p>
