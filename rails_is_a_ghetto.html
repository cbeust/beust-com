          <h2>Rails Is A Ghetto</h2>


	<p>I&#8217;ve more or less kept my mouth shut about some of the dumb and plain evil
stuff that goes on in the Rails community.  As things would happen though
I&#8217;d take notes, collect logs, and started writing this little essay.
As soon as I was stable and didn&#8217;t need Ruby on Rails to survive I told
myself I&#8217;d revamp my blog and expose these fucks.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: This post is currently an open draft.  Feel free to comment but it will have spelling and grammar errors and some paragraphs might not make sense.  Check my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/index.html">blog</a> and my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://www.zedshaw.com/feed.atom">atom feed</a> to find out when I post the updates.</strong></p>


	<p>This is that rant.  It is part of my grand exit strategy from the Ruby and
Rails community.  I don&#8217;t want to be a &#8220;Ruby guy&#8221; anymore, and will probably
start getting into more Python, Factor, and Lua in the coming months.  I&#8217;ve
got about three or four more projects in the works that will use all of those
and not much Ruby planned.</p>


	<p>This rant is full of stories about companies and people who&#8217;ve either pissed
in my cheerios somehow or screwed over friends.  I can back all of them up from
emails, <span class="caps">IRC</span> chat logs, or with witnesses.  Nothing in here is a lie unless it&#8217;s
really obviously a lie through exaggeration, and there&#8217;s a lot of my opinion 
as well.</p>


	<p>The best part about ripping on these guys though is this:</p>


	<pre><code>If they have a blog, speak at conferences, publish papers, 
or write books then they are <strong>public figures</strong> just like me.</code></pre>


	<p>This means that thanks to Larry Flynt I can stab them in the ear verbally,
insult them, question their sexual orientation, and say anything that&#8217;s
true and they just have to take it.  Their only recourse is to write their
pathetic little rebuttals in their stupid little blogs.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll add one more thing to the people reading this:  I mean business when I say
I&#8217;ll take anyone on who wants to fight me.  You think you can take me, I&#8217;ll
<strong>pay</strong> to rent a boxing ring and beat your fucking ass legally.  Remember that
I&#8217;ve studied enough martial arts to be deadly even though I&#8217;m old, <strong>and</strong> I don&#8217;t
give a fuck if I kick your mother fucking ass or you kick mine.  You don&#8217;t like
what I&#8217;ve said, then write something in reply but fuck you if you think you&#8217;re
gonna talk to me like you can hurt me.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll never be afraid of some pilsner fresh fat fuck who eats donut hamburgers
and only gets exercise when he plays World of Warcraft on a <span class="caps">DDR</span> pad.</p>


	<p>To prime the pump, let&#8217;s talk about Kevin Clark.  Me and Kevin don&#8217;t get along
because he once tried to demand some free tech support out of me for Mongrel.
His dumb little company <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://www.powerset.com/">VaporSet</a> had this stupid
setup where the people deploying Rails didn&#8217;t have root access.  I told Kevin
that this was stupid and apparently it was Kevin&#8217;s idea because he told
me &#8220;fuck you&#8221;.  Ever since then Kevin&#8217;s been a mouthy little shit with nothing
to back it up.</p>


	<p>This particular discussion started with Kevin Clark deciding to tell me that my
idea to restrict access to the main repository for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/">Utu</a> until it&#8217;s solid makes me
a &#8220;dick&#8221;.  But, read to the end of the chat for the punch line.  It&#8217;s great.</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
02:18 &lt; zedas&gt; evan: http://utuprotocol.info/repos/
02:18 &lt; kevinclark&gt; evan: I thought so too, but it still seems to 
                    happen (atleast on my system). And lightning has 
                    a few that hang out
02:18 &lt; zedas&gt; evan: http://utuprotocol.info/repos/utu/changes.rss 
               is generated from an included xslt i hacked up
02:18 &lt;@evan&gt; zedas: and who can push code to that location?
02:18 &lt; zedas&gt; me
02:18 &lt; MenTaLguY&gt; large git clones can also get kind of bad
02:18 &lt;@evan&gt; see, thats the problem.
02:19 &lt;@evan&gt; kevinclark: hang out?
02:19 &lt; zedas&gt; not a problem at all.  feature since i don't trust 
               any you mofos :-)
02:19 &lt;@evan&gt; kevinclark: you mean missing files?
02:19 &lt;@evan&gt; zedas: then you're set!
02:19 &lt; kevinclark&gt; evan: I mean generated files are sitting in svn
02:19 &lt; zedas&gt; evan: no, people can contribute by doing a darcs send 
               which packs it up and shoots it to my email.
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Then kevin comes in:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
02:21 &lt;@evan&gt; we've got very different ideas about how to deal with 
              contribution, i suspect.
02:21 &lt; zedas&gt; i also anticipate that there won't be so many people 
               contributing directly on the main utu server, but 
               more contributing by writing clients or tools that 
               use it
02:21 &lt; kevinclark&gt; evan: I'd say you're polar opposites
02:22 &lt; zedas&gt; how's that kevinclark?
02:22 &lt; kevinclark&gt; zedas: I thought you weren't talking to me
02:22 &lt; boyscout&gt; kev * [1003] /rubinius/trunk (8 files) add 
                  rb_hash_delete
02:24 &lt; zedas&gt; kevinclark: well i'm gonna talk to you if you're 
               making passive aggressive little comments
02:24 &lt; kevinclark&gt; zedas: they aren't passive aggressive. You don't 
                    want anyone to check in to your repo. Evan's 
                    repo is open to anyone who's gotten a patch in. 
                    polar opposites
02:24 &lt; kevinclark&gt; and you're still a dick
02:25 &lt; kevinclark&gt; and I'm enjoying the vacation
02:25 &lt; kevinclark&gt; so, keep it up
02:27 &lt; zedas&gt; kevinclark: you just called me a dick?
02:27 &lt; kevinclark&gt; you can still read too
02:27 &lt; kevinclark&gt; awesome
02:27 &lt; zedas&gt; hmmm
02:27 &lt; zedas&gt; well, i'll just leave this alone for now.
02:27 &lt; zedas&gt; sorry about that evan.
02:28 &lt;@evan&gt; no problem.
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>And then kevin demonstrates why I&#8217;m trying to limit people&#8217;s access to the main
repository:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
02:47 &lt; brixen&gt; evan: lighting is using autoconf?
02:47 &lt; brixen&gt; er lightning
02:48 &lt;@evan&gt; yeah
02:48 &lt;@evan&gt; well, crap.
02:48 &lt;@evan&gt; lightning is faulting on i386
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; hmm?
02:48 &lt; brixen&gt; yeah r1003 deleted configure
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; working on mine now
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; oh, crap
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; I thought configure was generated
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; from autoconf
02:48 &lt;@evan&gt; really?
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; all my build tools do it ;)
02:48 &lt; kevinclark&gt; sorry
02:48 &lt; brixen&gt; well, not from our .configure
02:48 &lt;@evan&gt; brixen: it should be there.
02:49 &lt; brixen&gt; I'll restore from r1002
02:49 &lt; kevinclark&gt; brixen: cool. sorry about that.
02:49 &lt; brixen&gt; just wasn't sure if the build steps had changed
02:49 &lt; brixen&gt; kevinclark: np
02:50 &lt;@evan&gt; brixen: wtf.
02:50 &lt;@evan&gt; why did it get deleted....
02:50 &lt;@evan&gt; kevinclark: did you delete it?
02:51 &lt; kevinclark&gt; evan: I did. Too much time with buildtools that 
                    were generating configure for me, and I got 
                    confused.
02:51 &lt; kevinclark&gt; evan: It got caught with the docs that got 
                    modified
02:51 &lt; kevinclark&gt; and I didn't think twice about it
02:52 &lt;@evan&gt; yeah, just restore it plz, kthxomgwtfbbq
02:52 &lt; kevinclark&gt; evan: working on it ;)
02:52 &lt; kevinclark&gt; brixen: you're doing the restore, yeah?
02:52 &lt; brixen&gt; yeah, one sec
02:52 &lt; brixen&gt; was just checking it would build

</blockquote>

	<p>Wow, rails is a ghetto.  The little prick calls me a dick (and in private
chat said he&#8217;d find me at the next conference but of course never did),
then he <strong>deletes the fucking configure file for the project!</strong>  Remember
he was working on <span class="caps">GNU</span> lightning when I started chatting, so this means
that it took an hour for everyone to figure out that his dumb fuck ass
deleted it.</p>


	<p>Why is this ghetto?  Any experienced developer knows that autoconf
configure files are a <strong><span class="caps">PAIN IN THE ASS</span></strong> to recreate.  They almost always
require special reconfigure calls, special m4 macros, or just time.  You
usually get them right, generate them once, and then leave them in your
repository for all to use.  To make it worse, Kevin actually wrote a
supposed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://mkrf.rubyforge.org/">alternative to autoconf,</a> and yet <strong>he doesn&#8217;t know the most basic thing about autoconf</strong>.</p>


	<p>Only a fucking tool bag piece of shit would:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>spend 10-20 minutes calling me names over <span class="caps">IRC</span>, </li>
		<li>not have the balls to say any of that to my face, </li>
		<li>say I&#8217;m a dick for wanting to use a different (established) publish/review model,</li>
		<li>and then demolish such an important file for a project,</li>
		<li>keeping everyone stumped and pissed for an hour,</li>
		<li>therefore proving me right.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>This is exactly what makes Rails a ghetto.  A bunch of half-trained 
former <span class="caps">PHP</span> morons who never bother to sit down and really learn the
computer science they were too good to study in college.  <span class="caps">BTW</span>, this
is true about Kevin as he&#8217;s an English major or something stupid
(and it shows).</p>


	<p>Hats off to you Kevin, you fucking prick.  I&#8217;m enjoying my vacation too.</p>


	<p>After this, I started thinking, since it was the first realization that I picked
the absolute last wrong community to make my living in.  They were all pricks,
morons, assholes, and arrogant fucks who didn&#8217;t care about the art or the
craft.</p>


	<p>They were all a bunch of little ghetto fabulous princesses trying to make it in
this tiny little Rails world and not enough brains between them all to make it
happen.</p>


	<h2>Tied To The Rails</h2>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking this over ever since I realized that Mongrel and Rails
more or less killed my career.  During 2006 I was effectively homeless for
about 4-6 months out of the year and made no money at all.  During the
rest of the year the little money I made was impossible to get, and many
times I was simply not paid.</p>


	<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the totally kick ass <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie
Fernandez</a> I&#8217;d probably be slogging away in some McD&#8217;s
screaming, &#8220;you want fries with that?!&#8221;  He got me a really good gig
in Florida and I was able to get back on my feet.  Obie rocks, and he&#8217;s also a good family man, treats his kids well, and is very smart.  He&#8217;s one of the few gems of the Ruby world.</p>


	<p><strong>Before</strong> Mongrel I was building kick ass software for the <span class="caps">NYC</span> Dept. of 
Correction with a tiny team.  We were doing innovative stuff like <span class="caps">REST</span>
<span class="caps">XML</span> feeds of prisoner releases and <span class="caps">RSS</span> of prisoner transfers.  It was
fun, I was in charge, and things were pretty good.</p>


	<p>Before that I built software for finger print readers, network protocols,
designed business processes, lead software teams, created portals, and
generally rocked as a consultant.</p>


	<p>After Mongrel I couldn&#8217;t get a gang of monkeys to rape me, so forget any jobs.
Sure people would contact me for their tiny little start-ups, but I&#8217;d eventually
catch on that they just want to use me to implement their ideas.  Their ideas
were horrendously lame.  I swear if someone says they&#8217;re starting a social
network I&#8217;m gonna beat them with the heel of my shoe.</p>


	<h2>The Stories I Could (and Will) Tell</h2>


	<p>One company tried to get me to sign a contract that required me to list all of
my inventions, software, cooking recipes, works of art, writings, poems, essays,
thoughts, ideas, patentable or unpatentable, prior to taking a <strong>2 hour per
week gig mentoring someone</strong>.  The list of shit they wanted went on and on,
 and after I refused and just ignored them they still kept asking me.</p>


	<p>Another company told me they had a great job for me and that I&#8217;d be perfect for
them.  I knew these guys so I at first trusted them, but what a mistake.  Turns
out that it wasn&#8217;t a job they had, it was an <span class="caps">RFP</span> that they wanted to bid for and
put my name on the bid so they&#8217;d have an advantage.  Alright, that&#8217;s fine but
that means they&#8217;re using my name and reputation (that I earned) in a business
transaction without telling me.  Fine, I better get some fat cash.  They then
build the team and dole out the positions:  Software Architect to the shithead
who can&#8217;t code; Project Manager to the <span class="caps">MBA</span> asshole who talks like a car
salesman; Lead Engineer to the guy using my shit to run his company.  What do
they give me?  Nothing.  I&#8217;m just Zed.  Nobody needs my skills.</p>


	<p>Other companies would hire me to fix something simple, I&#8217;d quote them $500 or so
to do it, and then they&#8217;d refuse to pay if it didn&#8217;t take me a week to do.  In
one case I did something in about 5 minutes, sent off my automated billing <span class="caps">PDF</span>
and they just flat refused.  I had to work for another hour and even then they
didn&#8217;t want to pay.</p>


	<p>A company in <span class="caps">NYC</span> flew me out, put me up, and I gave them a cut-throat deal on my
rate if they&#8217;d pay me quick.  I needed the money to pay rent, so it had to be
right after the two weeks of work.  About the middle of the week I hear that the
<span class="caps">CEO</span> isn&#8217;t going to pay me right away but is instead going to do <span class="caps">NET</span>-30 (an evil
    practice reserved only for furniture sales).  I tell the guys that I got to
go and I&#8217;d like my money, but they refuse, I fly out, and I don&#8217;t get paid for
<strong>60 days.</strong>  What&#8217;d I do for them?  Oh only a custom Mongrel server, a clean
deployment to Mongrel from fastcgi, and a ton of training for their main man.</p>


	<p>Then there&#8217;s the social network idiots.  They all have a social
network plus something fucking stupid to sell, but of course no <span class="caps">MBA</span> can actually
code so they come running to me.  However, there&#8217;s a slight problem.  You see,
<strong>I have a business degree you cock suckers.</strong>  If you tell me that your
social network will take on facebook because it includes baby pictures then
I&#8217;m going to laugh in your face.  They are an established player with <span class="caps">CIA</span>
backing.  You won&#8217;t wipe them out.</p>


	<p>Google was a total riot.  They offered me a job twice.  I went with it, and they
never responded.  Probably because the job they were offering me&#8212;someone who&#8217;s
been coding for 21 years, 15 professionally&#8212;was as a <strong>junior system
administrator</strong>.  What the hell does a junior sysadmin do at google?  That&#8217;s
probably like mopping the floor at a glory hole in Queens.  I told them to review my resume and offer me a real position.</p>


	<h2>Revenge Of The Zen Prick</h2>


	<p>In Vancouver it was even weirder.  There was no Rails there, and the only Ruby
on Rails work was at this shitty little company I once worked for name Raymond
James.  I worked for them on a small gig, not doing much coding, just getting a
project they screwed up out the door.  Later I got into it with their
&#8220;Development Manager&#8221; Alex Bunardzic over e-mail where he says something
strange:</p>


<blockquote>
I would think twice before doing something like that, if I were you. As a
Development Manager at Raymond James, I am privy to the work details you did for
us some time ago (it&#8217;s all here, meticulously classified by [MANAGER]), and I
must say that your references from that job are far from being stellar. To put
things extremely mildly, you&#8217;ve ended up on our &#8216;not to rehire&#8217; black list.

	<p>You may be looking for work, and people will naturally start asking around.
I have plenty of contacts in the industry, and you know how people are when
hiring&#8212;looking for references and for some feedback.</p>


I&#8217;m afraid that, after just reviewing the code you&#8217;ve delivered here, I
won&#8217;t be in the position to say many encouraging things about the quality of
your work, not to mention your personality traits.
</blockquote>

	<p>We go at it for a bit, because I didn&#8217;t actually write much code for them and I
sure as hell didn&#8217;t write bad code since, you know, the damn project actually
ran after I got there.  Hell, I reverse engineered a Java library they bought
but lost the source to so we could patch it.  They even asked me to come in a
few times and help on short gigs after my initial work.  How the hell was I on a
blacklist, why did they have a blacklist, why didn&#8217;t I know, and why the hell
was Alex telling people this shit?</p>


	<p>As the exchange unfolds (where apparently my use of foul language is bad but his threatening my livelihood is all right), Alex the Zen Master confesses that he got things wrong:</p>


<blockquote>
Here I need to apologize&#8212;I went back and looked over the
documentation, and was shocked to realize that I&#8217;ve confused you with
another person! That person&#8217;s name is Shai, and because that name was
on a quick glance so close to Shaw, I&#8217;ve made a blunder and jumped at
the premature conclusions.

	<p>...</p>


So please scratch all the things I wrote previously concerning your
past performance&#8212;all of that applies to some person whose name is
Shain.
</blockquote>

	<p>That&#8217;s right, this moronic idiot basically told (or just threatened to tell) everybody I was a shitty coder,
refused to hire me, threatened me with slander, and tried to destroy me
because he confused me with a &#8220;Shai&#8221; or a &#8220;Shain&#8221; in his blacklist.  He even
later tried to tell me that there <strong>wasn&#8217;t</strong> a blacklist.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s the guy who is a development manager for an entire company and he can&#8217;t
even tell the difference between two completely different people in some weirdo
black list.  All the more reason to leave Vancouver and try again somewhere else
with people who don&#8217;t pretend to be Zen masters while they&#8217;re treating you like
shit with a perfect half smile on their face.</p>


	<h2>How&#8217;d This Happen?</h2>


	<p>Over and over again I&#8217;d run into these morons who would offer me tiny jobs, no
jobs, insult my intelligence, treat me like all I can do is code, and when I
didn&#8217;t fit that mold or wanted to charge them for the privilege they&#8217;d cheat me
or laugh at me.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of background on me:  My education is in business.  I have a BS in <span class="caps">MIS</span> and
almost finished my MS but ran out of money.  I&#8217;ve got more business education than
most of the MBAs out there, <strong>and</strong> I have a nearly formal education in software
development, modeling, statistical analysis, and sociology.  I&#8217;ve done it all,
but what does the slick talking shit head car sales <span class="caps">MBA</span> loser think I am?</p>


	<pre><code>Just a code monkey.</code></pre>


	<p>I have this rule that when life isn&#8217;t going well I have to look at myself very 
hard first, make the changes that might improve things, and then start looking
at who&#8217;s stomping on my day.</p>


	<p>After revitalizing myself, getting out of the Rails business (or trying),
distancing myself from Mongrel, disconnecting from the Ruby community,
and focusing on my business skills, I finally felt ready to figure out
why the hell the Rails community is so completely and totally useless,
stupid, and arrogant.</p>


	<p>I believe, if I could point at one thing it&#8217;s the following statement
on 2007-01-20 to me by David H. creator of Rails:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
(15:11:12) DHH: before fastthread we had ~400 restarts/day
(15:11:22) DHH: now we have perhaps 10
(15:11:29) Zed S.: oh nice
(15:11:33) Zed S.: and that's still fastcgi right?
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Notice how it took me a few seconds to reply.  This one single statement
basically means that we all got duped.  The main Rails application that
<span class="caps">DHH</span> created required restarting ~400 times/day.  That&#8217;s a production 
application that can&#8217;t stay up for more than 4 minutes on average.</p>


	<p>Let me put this into perspective for you:  I&#8217;ve ran servers that needed 
to be restarted once in a year.  They were written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Python, Java, 
C, C++, you name it.  Hell, I&#8217;ve got this blog on a server I&#8217;ve restarted
maybe 10-20 times the whole year.</p>


	<p>Now, <span class="caps">DHH</span> tells me that he&#8217;s got <strong>400 restarts</strong> a mother fucking <strong>day</strong>. 
That&#8217;s 1 restart about ever 4 minutes bitches.  These
restarts went away after I exposed bugs in the GC and Threads which 
Mentalguy fixed with fastthread (like a Ninja, Mentalguy is awesome).</p>


	<p>If anyone had known Rails was that unstable they would have laughed in his face.
Think about it further, this means that the <strong>creator</strong> of Rails in his flagship
products could not keep them running for <strong>longer than 4 minutes on average.</strong></p>


	<p>Repeat that to yourself.  &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t keep his own servers running for longer than 4 minutes on average.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Assuming his statements are true (which we may never know) he basically duped us all.</p>


	<p>Now I&#8217;m glad he did since Rails is a pretty nice idea, and it demolished the Java world
I hated so much.  What bothers me though, is that while all of the Rails Core fuck tards
would insult me, tell me I was wrong, laugh at me, marginalize me, tell me I was a waste of
space, that I &#8220;jumed the shark&#8221;, they were quietly taking my work and using it to improve
their festering shit pile deployments.</p>


	<p>In fact, in chats with me and them where I started to identify the GC, Threads, and IO all
I ever got was denial from guys like Dave Thomas, Michael Koziarski, and Chad Fowler.
Remember that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2006/Dec/1017363.html">nasty cgi.rb bug</a> that
is fixed with a monkey patch in Mongrel?  Did you guys know that Michael K. and Dave Thomas pretty much
threatened me into not releasing a Mongrel fix for the problem for <strong>three months</strong>?  They actually
let it sit for three months before other people crafted the cgi_multipart_eof_fix which I
could include.</p>


	<p>In the beginning, was this huge lie, but after that&#8230;</p>


	<h2>Then The Idiots Came</h2>


	<p>My theory on why Rails is a ghetto is best summarized by an observation I made about
Michael Koziarski.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://www.koziarski.com/">Here&#8217;s is fat fucking face</a> just in
case you don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m talking about.  See, here&#8217;s the thing about Koz:  He&#8217;s got 
a big mouth he runs when he&#8217;s online, but in person he doesn&#8217;t say shit.  He loves
talking shit about me when I&#8217;m not around apparently, insults me when he wants, but
the best thing about Michael Koziarski is this:</p>


	<p>When he tells people I&#8217;m an asshole they go, &#8220;Zed&#8217;s such a prick I hate him.&#8221;</p>


	<p>When I tell people Mike&#8217;s a fucktard loser, they say,</p>


	<pre><code>"Who?"</code></pre>


	<p>That&#8217;s right, dude works on Rails in some capacity, apparently writing tons of
shitty fucking code with his butt buddy Nicholas Sekar.  Yet, nobody knows him.
He&#8217;s got more web sites than Elvis and Chuck Noris combined and nobody knows
him.  He&#8217;s written <strong>mountains</strong> more open source code than me and no-bo-dy knows
him.</p>


	<p>He&#8217;s a fucking loser, and man he used to bug me.  Now however, I don&#8217;t give a
shit about Rails so he&#8217;s a little fly.  Rails is my money maker platform I don&#8217;t
invest in at all.  Rails could sink in the ocean for all I care and I&#8217;d roll on to
my next big thing.  I&#8217;ve done the right thing by giving Mongrel to a great team,
and if Rails dies, then awesome because little useless pricks like MK will
probably fall off the planet into that part of hell where shitty managers end
up.</p>


	<p>The best part about the whole thing is there&#8217;s potentially 10 new web frameworks
that can take on Rails.  Hell, Mongrel spawned or helped 5 of those.  My
favorite of those frameworks is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> which is literally
&#8220;Mongrel plus Erb&#8221; but now it uses Erubis mostly.  What I love about Merb is
that it proved you could make a fast thread safe Ruby web framework with all the
same ideas as Rails and using most of the Rails gear at the same time.  However,
the joke is that before Merb the Rails Core morons would scream up and down
you can&#8217;t make Rails thread safe.  Ezra however proved them all wrong by
just writing a better Rails than Rails and all thanks to Mongrel being so
easy to hack and work with.</p>


	<p>If the Rails guys had given me even an ounce of respect and listened to me I
might have helped them, but instead I wanted to make sure that they didn&#8217;t rule
the world because when I listened to them shit talk about the community that
made them famous I wanted to scream.</p>


	<p>Alright, but let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m totally wrong and Koz is really a great coder who&#8217;s
just staying under the radar?  Alright, remember the change to Rails to allow
this?</p>


<pre>http://mysite.com/controller/action;edit</pre>

	<p>That one little &#8217;;&#8217; was the cause of some serious pain for people since it&#8217;s
actually not a proper request the way they interpret it.  Requests with &#8217;;&#8217; in them
are considered path parameters which are kind of like query parameters.  Koz and <span class="caps">DHH</span> and
crew added this, but I told them that&#8217;s not right, they should use something
else like, uh, oh, maybe fucking <strong>&#8217;/&#8217;</strong>.  They ignored me.  Did it anyway.  Then
when it was clearly obvious they were wrong (since Mongrel&#8217;s got a tight parser)
who was out there defending this decision?  Fucking Koz.  Great programmers
don&#8217;t defend stupid, they stamp it out and own up to their mistakes.</p>


	<p>Fuck you Koz.  You don&#8217;t speak.</p>


	<p>Ruby on Rails has become full of people like Koz, with Koz the most
senior of the wannabe smarties.  Koz got lucky at best and injected
his shitty coding into a good project, fucked it up, and then latched
on to security as the way to get more control.  Of course he doesn&#8217;t
actually know anything about secure coding which is why his code seems
to have lots of the bugs (go check out the date parsing shit.  Clue: months
don&#8217;t always have 30 days).</p>


	<p>When I hang out with the Nitro, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://www.factorcode.org/">Factor</a>, Django,
Lua, Python, Lisp, or Mongrel crews I get to talk to super smart guys who have
egos for sure, but have mutual respect.  They craft nifty shit I love to play
with, are fun to talk with even when I disagree, and don&#8217;t say mean shit when
I&#8217;m not around.</p>


	<p>With Rails I get scrawny cock suckers with carpal tunnel syndrome talking
to me like they&#8217;re gonna eat my young.  Their feeble <span class="caps">PHP</span> infected minds
can&#8217;t grasp advanced shit like objects or closures.  When you combine
stupid businesses with stupid people using a stupid framework based on a
big fat fucking lie on a shitty platform you get the perfect storm
of dumbfuck where a man like me can&#8217;t find work.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s no work for a smart man in a town full of stupid.</p>


	<h2>The Hysteria Of Consultancy</h2>


	<p>Where I work the company is willing to blow huge amounts of money on
a consulting firm or hardware, but ends up firing people when times
get tight.  It&#8217;s a universal mass hysteria that paying $100 &#8211; $200 
per hour for a group of consultants is preferable to simply hiring
good employees.  At the rates companies pay these consultants
they could hire 4 full time employees.</p>


	<p>Consultancies used to provide a service by managing the entire project
so you didn&#8217;t have to do much.  Now with Agile and Pair Programming
the consulting firms can dupe clients into helping them make the
sausage, provide little to no services, yet still charge insane
rates.  What&#8217;s impressive is these consulting firms somehow charge
rates that are 5 or 6 <strong>times</strong> what they pay their employees.</p>


	<p>Think about that.  How is it possible that your consulting firm
has so much inefficiency they must charge 600%
overhead?  Are the services you get <strong>really</strong> that far above the
base pay of that employee?  Why the hell not just hire someone
and have a long term learner who&#8217;ll be ready to work on anything?</p>


	<p>Accounting, that&#8217;s why.  When you hire a Full Time Employee (FTE)
you need to account for it and budget them differently than if 
you pay a firm for a consultant.  There&#8217;s several loop holes in
the tax and accounting standards that make a consultant seem
cheaper than a regular employee.</p>


	<p>However, this is a mass hysteria.  Eventually people will catch
on that the quality they get for the price they pay isn&#8217;t there.
A smart consultancy will figure out that they could undercut these
idiot firms by simply using technology properly to cut costs and
reduce overhead.  Hell, you&#8217;ve got 600% overhead to work with.
Should be easy to pull a Southwest Airlines on them.</p>


	<p>Let&#8217;s take ThoughtWorks as a classic example of the hysteria.  They
decided to get into the Ruby on Rails game and went full bore.  I was
telling people right when Rails came out that doing it for internal projects
at big companies would be a huge money maker.  Nobody believed me, and now
rather than all my smart friends working on cool applications for
big money I have ThoughtWorks fucking up my party.</p>


	<p>Before you continue this part of the rant ask yourself a question:</p>


	<p>How did ThoughtWorks go from 0% Rails business to 60% Rails in just
a few short months, but somehow didn&#8217;t hire that many top notch
Ruby guys?  Remember, if 60% of your business is Rails then 60% of
your people need Rails training or else you have to hire more people.
If they didn&#8217;t hire any more people than that means&#8230;the people they
had were retrained.  With two week training courses.  Huh?  How does
that make them experts?</p>


	<p>What happens if you do that is you have a group of former C# and Java
guys running around writing shitty Ruby code and training on the client&#8217;s
dime for huge fees.</p>


	<p>Think for a second.  ThoughtWorks charges its clients a premium price
for expertise.  They claim that their Agile methods and development
expertise means they&#8217;ll produce a great result.  This is why you
pay them a premium.  However, they reserve the right to control staffing,
and you have very little say in the skills of the people they place.</p>


	<p>Continue the logic further my friends with this little walk through
consulting practices:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>TW figures out it can make a mint doing RoR projects for dumb ass MBAs at dumbass
companies.</li>
		<li>TW goes for it and gets 60% of its business now all RoR.</li>
		<li>TW realizes that they can&#8217;t hire enough Ruby people to do that.  Actually, they
didn&#8217;t really try too hard since that&#8217;d mean paying the new people a fair salary.</li>
		<li>Yet, somehow they put 6-20 people on projects and claim that these people are Rails
experts with a high standard of quality.  These people actually had two weeks of training.</li>
		<li>After each person has been on a project for a few months, they mysteriously get 
transitioned to another project, become &#8220;sick&#8221;, or generally leave.</li>
		<li>They are then replaced with someone else who&#8217;s training is limited.</li>
		<li>During their operations they seem to focus entirely on the process, but very
little on the quality of the code.  Sorry guys, but having a 1:4 code:test ratio
is not focusing on code quality.  It&#8217;s focusing on <strong>test</strong> quality.</li>
		<li>Finally, when your project is in the dumps and it takes months to get simple
things done you realize that you&#8217;ve been paying ThoughtWorks a premium for
what is effectively a bunch of total newbies who are only there for a few
months before they roll off.</li>
		<li><strong>You my friend got fucked in the ass.</strong>  Congratulations because all the idiots
who paid ThoughtWorks 6x times salary for junior ass wipes got taken and simply paid
to train ThoughtWorks&#8217; new crew.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>How do I know this?  Well, I&#8217;ve been a consultant for years and recently I&#8217;ve
taken over two ThoughtWorks Ruby on Rails projects.  <span class="caps">BTW</span>, they claim they don&#8217;t
do &#8220;Ruby on Rails&#8221; projects, but actually do &#8220;Ruby&#8221; projects.  They also claim
they don&#8217;t do &#8220;eXtreme Programming&#8221; but do &#8220;Agile&#8221;.  Doing this little semantics
juggle means you can never hold them to any standard of quality.</p>


	<p>In the two projects I&#8217;ve taken from ThoughtWorks I found mountains of horrible,
horrible code.  They of course try to pull the classic &#8220;there&#8217;s many ways to
do everything in programming&#8221; but this time they kind of get caught because
Ruby on <strong>Rails</strong> means stay on the Rails.  There <strong>is</strong> an established best
practice way to build web applications with <strong>Rails</strong> and that&#8217;s the entire
point of the system.  When ThoughtWorks fucked up these projects they did it
in such a completely deviated way that it was impossible to defend.</p>


	<p>Additionally, the people they placed on these projects were not well trained at all,
had no idea about simple Ruby idioms let alone good design, and spent more of their
time drinking and having fun than actually getting shit done.  At the last project they
actually had bottles of Pedialyte in the fridge to help with their hangovers after
wild nights partying.</p>


	<p>After ThoughtWorks left the most recent project we revamped the team.  We got
rid of pair programming, cut down the number of tests, started cleaning more and
more code out, got rid of their shitty tools, and we all started leaving at 6pm.
What happens?</p>


	<p>We <strong>doubled</strong> our productivity with <strong>fewer</strong> people.  Yes, that is a verifiable
metrically validated claim I can back up.  Just like the horrible quality of the
code, their idiotic defense of it, and their very bad job at designing even the
basics of the business model required.  Remember, they are testing and svn whores
so their failure on these two projects is very well documented.</p>


	<p>However, what really ticks me off about ThoughtWorks isn&#8217;t the way they fucked up 
these two projects.  I&#8217;d take ThoughtWorks over <span class="caps">IBM</span>, Accenture, or BearingPoint
any day of the week.  ThoughtWorks&#8217; competitors are even worse, so I&#8217;ll take
the lesser of ten evils any day.  What pisses me off is that I know they&#8217;re responsible
for turning Ruby on Rails into the next Visual Basic.  Why?  Because they wrote
in a position paper that Ruby on Rails was like Visual Basic.  Yes, they did that.
They compared Ruby on Rails to probably the most technically vilified language
in the history of computing.</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s my prediction about ThoughtWorks:  They&#8217;ll continue to screw customers
over by training their employees on their client&#8217;s dime and write tons of
fucked up software.  The bad results from ThoughtWorks will kill Ruby on Rails
for companies as these companies are left with a bad taste from bad implementations.</p>


	<h2>From Industry to Corporate</h2>


	<p>ThoughtWorks is simply taking advantage of a pattern where new technology goes
from fringe to corporate and then dies.  A great example of this is Java
Portals.  They started out on the fringe at universities and non-profits, where
they were mildly successful.  Then they migrated into the corporate world where
they were complete disasters, and finally the risk averse government picked them
up for even less success.</p>


	<p>How do I know this?  I worked on portals for their entire life and followed them
through this process.  Go look.  I did some of the first work on uPortal, then
I worked on portals in companies, and then worked on them for the government.</p>


	<p>Ruby on Rails is following the same trajectory I&#8217;m afraid, and ThoughtWorks is 
milking it while they can.  First it started on the fringe in start-ups and a 
few lonely places where it&#8217;s having mixed success (mostly due to the poor
performance of the Ruby platform).  Now it&#8217;s getting adopted internally at
companies where of course it&#8217;ll get fucked up again and die off.  After that
it&#8217;ll move to the government sector where it will languish along with it&#8217;s
new found buddy <span class="caps">COBOL</span>.</p>


	<p>Oh, did I mention ThoughtWorks compared Rails to <span class="caps">COBOL</span> as well?  Awesome.</p>


	<h2>Fighting Consulting Firms</h2>


	<p>I have a few pieces of advice for people about to hire any company like
ThoughtWorks.  There&#8217;s just a few simple strategies you can follow to 
make sure you get the most out of them and get your money&#8217;s worth:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Make sure you have the right to see every resume and interview each
consultant they place.  Treat them like new hires and don&#8217;t let anyone
who&#8217;s not worth the rate you&#8217;re paying on the team.</li>
		<li>Demand a variable rate based on the position of the person and their
experience.</li>
		<li>Demand that no employees can leave the project to work on another 
project.  These placements have to be for the life of the project 
or until the employee quits.</li>
		<li>Require that you have the right to have someone replaced if they are
not immediately capable.  Part of what you&#8217;re paying is that a ThoughtWorker
should be able to drop in commando style and just start working.  The
reality is they are usually totally lost anyway.</li>
		<li>Seriously consider recruiting one full time employee as a team lead,
another as a project manager, and then staff the rest of your team with
independent consultants.  You&#8217;ll find that you get more control and better
quality at a lower price.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Finally, a company like ThoughtWorks uses bizarre socialization processes
and weird shit like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103072111/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">Neuro-Linguistic Programming</a>
to enslave their employees into working more hours than needed.  That
shit about &#8220;can&#8217;t leave with a broken build&#8221;, pair programming, hazing rituals,
firing people who don&#8217;t conform, and other unprofessional behavior mostly
exists to make employees pliable pawns.</p>


	<p>Why?  Because ThoughtWorks pays these people a salary that is fixed and
considered a sunk cost.  If they pay someone 60k/year and that person
works 40 hours/week then they are paying them about $29/hour.  If
they convince this idiot to work 60 hours/week then they are basically
paying the moron $19/hour.  If they can push them to 80 hour/week
then these idiots are actually making $14/hour.  You can make $29/hour
managing a fast food joint.</p>


	<p>The further and harder ThoughtWorks (or any consulting firm) pushes its
employees the more money they make because then they charge the client
<strong>for each fucking hour</strong>.  Get it?  If they push an employee to 60/week
they not only reduce the cost of that employee but <strong>also</strong> increase the
billable hours.  Hell, even if they don&#8217;t charge for those hours they
still make more money just by reducing costs.</p>


	<p>Now I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t see ThoughtWorks do this quite as much as I&#8217;ve seen <span class="caps">IBM</span>
Global Services, Accenture, and BearingPoint do it, but they still do it.  My
observation about ThoughtWorks is they&#8217;re really really <strong>really</strong> fucking weird
about it.  I saw them pull passive aggressive shit like picking on a single
employee high-school-nerd-vs-jock style until he conforms or quits.</p>


	<p>What&#8217;s this got to do with your project?  Well, if you have a mix of
ThoughtWorks employees and your own then be careful that the ThoughtWorkers
don&#8217;t warp your employees as well.  I&#8217;ve seen it once already where a room full
of ThoughtWorkers would thrash and trash on one poor employee simply because he
disagreed with their approach to a problem.  Or, having special boards on the
wall with &#8220;How Many Times Frank Is Late&#8221;.  Or, holding &#8220;dev lunches&#8221; (which I
called &#8220;dev <strong>lynches</strong>&#8220;) where they thrash client employees with alternative
opinions in order to maintain their stupid operations.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve seen it, and they do it.  Be careful of it as you&#8217;ll lose people
who are smart and not susceptible to that crap, or you&#8217;ll have a 
bunch of brain washed idiots at the end of the project.  It&#8217;s also
a horrible way to treat a client so don&#8217;t put up with it.</p>


	<h2>More To Come</h2>


	<p>This is a long rant I&#8217;m writing in serial form.  Stay tuned for more 
about Ruby conferences and why they suck, and why the Pickaxe book
is what killed Ruby.</p>
