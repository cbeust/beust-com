November 19th, 2002<p>
I attended the &quot;J2EE / .Net&quot; Smackdown, organized by the Software Development 
Forum, an independent organization.&nbsp; Sun and Microsoft were each 
represented by three panelists (note that the name of the even is misleading, it 
should really be called &quot;SunONE / .Net Smackdown&quot;.<p>
The format is simple:&nbsp; ten questions have been submitted to the 
participants a month ago and they will answer them all in turn in five minutes.&nbsp; 
Each party has the right to three rebuttals if they feel like contesting what 
the other boxer, I mean, participant, just said.<p>
What follows is a summary of the questions and their answers.&nbsp; Whenever I 
feel like adding a personal remark, I will do so with a <i> <font color="#0000FF">particular color</font></i>.<p>
<b>Opening statements</b><p>

      defining open standards, as opposed to MS who is trying to corrupt standards and promote tools that support  lock-ins in their technology.

      <td width="50%" valign="top">Benchmarks that you fund usually come out in 
      your favor.&nbsp; MS created a brand new application based on stored 
      procedures.&nbsp; Oracle tinkered with the SQL and ended up running faster 
      than the Microsoft server application (<font color="#0000FF"><i>that's news to me</i></font>).<p>
      After modifications, J2EE scaled 400% better than .Net.&nbsp; The 
      Middleware Company engineers haven't used their expertise.</p>
      <p>The Middleware Company apologized for what happened and a new round is planned.</p>
      <p>Lines of code comparison is misleading.&nbsp; .Net code is not object 
      oriented, pricing is wrong and extremely limited.&nbsp; They used JDK 1.3, 
      not 1.4.&nbsp; No database tuning, dubious hardware selection, doesn't use 
      EJB 2.0, no disclosure and the vendors involved never gave their 
      permission to use their software.</p>
      <p>Still, there is some value in this exercise:&nbsp; the same application 
      was ported on two different servers, proving the portability of J2EE.</td>
      <td width="50%" valign="top">&quot;They started it&quot;.&nbsp; (
      <font color="#0000FF"><i>:-)</i></font> )<p>Larry Ellison 
      claimed Oracle had the best server so Microsoft decided to contest this 
      claim.&nbsp; .Net was 28 times faster, which actually turned out to be more like 10 
      times after reevaluating the benchmark.&nbsp; In October 2002, Microsoft reprised.</p>
      <p>Why did they choose PetStore?&nbsp; 
      Because SpecJAppServer excludes .Net and Java isn't present on TPC-C and TPC-W.</p>
      <p>The Middleware Company approached MS to participate in re-test of J2EE vs. Net.&nbsp; The 
      results show that .Net bested the performances of two leading application 
      servers.</p>
      <p>.Net has a much lower price/performance ratio and delivers three times 
      the performance of Java.</p>
      <p>There are other factors to consider than performance.</td>
    </tr>

  <p>Microsoft wants one more minute for a rebuttal:<p>Larry Ellison 
  specifically targeted .Net as the contender to beat (<font color="#0000FF"><i>this is absolutely not my recollection 
  and I was present at <a href="http://beust.com/javaone-2001.html">that keynote at JavaOne</a>.&nbsp; 
I don't remember Ellison mentioning Microsoft, much less .Net.&nbsp; He was 
clearly targeting BEA in his claims.</i></font>).</p>
  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p>Nobody ever comes out a winner in this kind of face off, but overall, the 
  atmosphere was friendly even if the crowd seemed to be cheering J2EE more 
  often than .Net (this is Silicon Valley after all).&nbsp; However, I expected 
  this crowd to be much more of a J2EE captive audience than it was.&nbsp; While 
  Sun's points were usually loudly acclaimed, the Microsoft representatives got 
  their share of applauses as well.</p>
  <p>I suspect that the success of this event came mostly from the PetStore 
  controversy.&nbsp; For anyone who has been even a little involved in this 
  fiasco, there was little to be learned, but I believe that the show has served 
  its purpose.</p>
  <p>One last note:&nbsp; Microsoft was giving away the book &quot;C# for Java 
  developers&quot;.</p>
